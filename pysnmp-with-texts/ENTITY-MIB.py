An enumerated value that provides an indication of the general hardware type of a particular physical entity. There are no restrictions as to the number of entPhysicalEntries of each entPhysicalClass, which must be instantiated by an agent. The enumeration 'other' is applicable if the physical entity class is known but does not match any of the supported values. The enumeration 'unknown' is applicable if the physical entity class is unknown to the agent. The enumeration 'chassis' is applicable if the physical entity class is an overall container for networking equipment. Any class of physical entity, except a stack, may be contained within a chassis; a chassis may only be contained within a stack. The enumeration 'backplane' is applicable if the physical entity class is some sort of device for aggregating and forwarding networking traffic, such as a shared backplane in a modular ethernet switch. Note that an agent may model a backplane as a single physical entity, which is actually implemented as multiple discrete physical components (within a chassis or stack). The enumeration 'container' is applicable if the physical entity class is capable of containing one or more removable physical entities, possibly of different types. For example, each (empty or full) slot in a chassis will be modeled as a container. Note that all removable physical entities should be modeled within a container entity, such as field-replaceable modules, fans, or power supplies. Note that all known containers should be modeled by the agent, including empty containers. The enumeration 'powerSupply' is applicable if the physical entity class is a power-supplying component. The enumeration 'fan' is applicable if the physical entity class is a fan or other heat-reduction component. The enumeration 'sensor' is applicable if the physical entity class is some sort of sensor, such as a temperature sensor within a router chassis. The enumeration 'module' is applicable if the physical entity class is some sort of self-contained sub-system. If the enumeration 'module' is removable, then it should be modeled within a container entity; otherwise, it should be modeled directly within another physical entity (e.g., a chassis or another module). The enumeration 'port' is applicable if the physical entity class is some sort of networking port capable of receiving and/or transmitting networking traffic. The enumeration 'stack' is applicable if the physical entity class is some sort of super-container (possibly virtual) intended to group together multiple chassis entities. A stack may be realized by a 'virtual' cable, a real interconnect cable, attached to multiple chassis, or may in fact be comprised of multiple interconnect cables. A stack should not be modeled within any other physical entities, but a stack may be contained within another stack. Only chassis entities should be contained within a stack. The enumeration 'cpu' is applicable if the physical entity class is some sort of central processing unit."

An NMS can use this object to identify the relative ordering for all sibling components of a particular parent (identified by the entPhysicalContainedIn instance in each sibling entry). If possible, this value should match any external labeling of the physical component. For example, for a container (e.g., card slot) labeled as 'slot #3', entPhysicalParentRelPos should have the value '3'. Note that the entPhysicalEntry for the module plugged in slot 3 should have an entPhysicalParentRelPos value of '1'. If the physical position of this component does not match any external numbering or clearly visible ordering, then user documentation or other external reference material should be used to determine the parent-relative position. If this is not possible, then the agent should assign a consistent (but possibly arbitrary) ordering to a given set of 'sibling' components, perhaps based on internal representation of the components. If the agent cannot determine the parent-relative position for some reason, or if the associated value of entPhysicalContainedIn is '0', then the value '-1' is returned. Otherwise, a non-negative integer is returned, indicating the parent-relative position of this physical entity. Parent-relative ordering normally starts from '1' and continues to 'N', where 'N' represents the highest positioned child entity. However, if the physical entities (e.g., slots) are labeled from a starting position of zero, then the first sibling should be associated with an entPhysicalParentRelPos value of '0'. Note that this ordering may be sparse or dense, depending on agent implementation. The actual values returned are not globally meaningful, as each 'parent' component may use different numbering algorithms. The ordering is only meaningful among siblings of the same parent component.
