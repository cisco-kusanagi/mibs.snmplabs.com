if mibBuilder.loadTexts: a3ComBackupAction.setDescription("This object actually starts the operation. The user's parameters MUST have been entered into the preceeding objects before a command is started. The objects SHOULD all be set using a single SNMP packet. This reduces the liklihood of one user altering another user's parameters inadvertantly. This object shall return notActive(1) when no operations are in progress. While an operation is in progress, it will return the enumeration for the operation that is in progress. When that operation finishes, this object shall return to notActive(1). The user may set this object to abortAction(2) at any time. This will abort any operation that is currently in progress. While the operation is being aborted, this object shall return abortAction(2). When the abort is complete, this value shall return to notActive(1). The a3ComBackupStatus shall be set to backupAbortedByUser(23) to indicate that the command was aborted. The user may only start any of the other operations when the state is notActive(1). Once an operation is in progress, this object shall return the enumeration for the operation until it completes. The outcome of the operation may be read from a3ComBackupStatus below. A device may refuse to carry out an operation if it is currently unable to carry out the operation or if the operation is not supported. In this case a bad value response shall be returned. The cliSave(3) operation saves the configuration as a list of CLI commands. If these commands are played back to the device, then the resultant configuration of the device would be that of the device when the backup was taken. The cliVerify(4) operation checks that a backup file contains the commands that the current configuration of the device would generate. The binarySave(5) and binaryVerify(6) operations are similar to the CLI operations. The difference being that the configuration is stored in a binary format rather than the CLI command format. The restoreConfig(7) operation will read the configuration from the specified file and apply it to the current device. It is assumed that the configuration file will have been generated by this device or by a device of identical configuration. If this is not the case, then the operation shall be aborted and the a3ComBackupStatus shall be set to backupWrongHardwareType. If any of the commands fail to execute, then the operation is aborted and a3ComBackupStatus is set to backupBadCommand or backupCommandFailed. The details of the failed command shall be stored in a3ComBackupFailedCommand and a3ComBackupFailureReason. The preceeding is a deliberate protection mechanism. It ensures that a user does not accidentally restore the wrong configuration to a device. However, there may be times when a user wants to copy the configuration from one type of device to another. The user may edit the file to remove commands that the new device does not understand. This could be a time consuming process. We therefore also allow the user the restoreIgnoringErrors(8) operation. This is similar to the restoreConfig(7) operation above with the exception that all errors are ignored and the restore passes onto the next configuration item in the backup file. The objects a3ComBackupFailedCommand and a3ComBackupFailureReason will contain details of the last error which occurred. As an additional protection mechanism, the user may also load just the comment fields from the backup file. These can then be displayed to the user so that they can confirm that they have selected the correct operation. In this case the user would select the loadDescriptionOnly(9) operation; wait for it to complete; display the comments to the user and ask for confiirmation; if the user is happy that it is the correct file it is then loaded using the restoreConfig(7) operation. Note: It is possible for another user to overwrite the parameters while the confirmation is awaited. The user SHOULD therefore set the parameters to the same values as were used for the loadDescriptionOnly(9) operation in the same SNMP packet as the setting of the restoreConfig(7) operation. The final operation is takeSnapshot(10). A snapshot creates a file which contains the current status of the device. This includes dynamic details such as what addresses have been learned on a port as well as the configuration details. This file is intended for human reading and contains the detail in a tabular format. A snapshot is similar to the output that would be created by running all of the display and summary commands on the device.")
