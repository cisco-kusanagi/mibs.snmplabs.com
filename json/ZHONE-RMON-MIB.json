In addition, implementations should accept values composed of well-formed UTF-8 sequences. It is suggested that this name contain one or more of the following: IP address, management station name, network manager's name, location, or phone number. In some cases the agent itself will be the owner of an entry. In these cases, this string shall be set to a string starting with 'monitor'. SNMP access control is articulated entirely in terms of the contents of MIB views; access to a particular SNMP object instance depends only upon its presence or absence in a particular MIB view and never upon its value or the value of related object instances. Thus, objects of this type afford resolution of resource contention only among cooperating managers; they realize no access control function with respect to uncooperative parties."

    "description": "The status of a table entry. Setting this object to the value invalid(4) has the effect of invalidating the corresponding entry. That is, it effectively disassociates the mapping identified with said entry. It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table. Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to receive tabular information from agents that corresponds to entries currently not in use. Proper interpretation of such entries requires examination of the relevant EntryStatus object. An existing instance of this object cannot be set to createRequest(2). This object may only be set to createRequest(2) when this instance is created. When this object is created, the agent may wish to create supplemental object instances with default values to complete a conceptual row in this table. Because the creation of these default objects is entirely at the option of the agent, the manager must not assume that any will be created, but may make use of any that are created. Immediately after completing the create operation, the agent must set this object to underCreation(3). When in the underCreation(3) state, an entry is allowed to exist in a possibly incomplete, possibly inconsistent state, usually to allow it to be modified in multiple PDUs. When in this state, an entry is not fully active. Entries shall exist in the underCreation(3) state until the management station is finished configuring the entry and sets this object to valid(1) or aborts, setting this object to invalid(4). If the agent determines that an entry has been in the underCreation(3) state for an abnormally long time, it may decide that the management station has crashed. If the agent makes this decision, it may set this object to invalid(4) to reclaim the entry. A prudent agent will understand that the management station may need to wait for human input and will allow for that possibility in its determination of this abnormally long period. An entry in the valid(1) state is fully configured and consistent and fully represents the configuration or operation such a row is intended to represent. For example, it could be a statistical function that is configured and active, or a filter that is available in the list of filters processed by the packet capture process. A manager is restricted to changing the state of an entry in the following ways: To: valid createRequest underCreation invalid From: valid OK NO OK OK createRequest N/A N/A N/A N/A underCreation OK NO OK OK invalid NO NO NO OK nonExistent NO OK NO OK In the table above, it is not applicable to move the state from the createRequest state to any other state because the manager will never find the variable in that state. The nonExistent state is not a value of the enumeration, rather it means that the entryStatus variable does not exist at all. An agent may allow an entryStatus variable to change state in additional ways, so long as the semantics of the states are followed. This allowance is made to ease the implementation of the agent and is made despite the fact that managers should never exercise these additional state transitions."

    "description": "The best estimate of the total number of collisions on this Ethernet segment. The value returned will depend on the location of the RMON probe. Section 8.2.1.3 (10BASE-5) and section 10.3.1.3 (10BASE-2) of IEEE standard 802.3 states that a station must detect a collision, in the receive mode, if three or more stations are transmitting simultaneously. A repeater port must detect a collision when two or more stations are transmitting simultaneously. Thus a probe placed on a repeater port could record more collisions than a probe connected to a station on the same segment would. Probe location plays a much smaller role when considering 10BASE-T. 14.2.1.4 (10BASE-T) of IEEE standard 802.3 defines a collision as the simultaneous presence of signals on the DO and RD circuits (transmitting and receiving at the same time). A 10BASE-T station can only detect collisions when it is transmitting. Thus probes placed on a station and a repeater, should report the same number of collisions. Note also that an RMON probe inside a repeater should ideally report collisions between the repeater and one or more other hosts (transmit collisions as defined by IEEE 802.3k) plus receiver collisions observed on any coax segments to which the repeater is connected."

A repeater port must detect a collision when two or more stations are transmitting simultaneously. Thus a probe placed on a repeater port could record more collisions than a probe connected to a station on the same segment would. Probe location plays a much smaller role when considering 10BASE-T. 14.2.1.4 (10BASE-T) of IEEE standard 802.3 defines a collision as the simultaneous presence of signals on the DO and RD circuits (transmitting and receiving at the same time). A 10BASE-T station can only detect collisions when it is transmitting. Thus probes placed on a station and a repeater, should report the same number of collisions. Note also that an RMON probe inside a repeater should ideally report collisions between the repeater and one or more other hosts (transmit collisions as defined by IEEE 802.3k) plus receiver collisions observed on any coax segments to which the repeater is connected."

Thus the management station has the ability to learn of new entries added to this table without downloading the entire table. It is important to note that the index for a particular entry may change as an (earlier) entry is deleted from the table. Because this order may change, management stations should make use of the hostControlLastDeleteTime variable in the hostControlEntry associated with the relevant portion of the hostTimeTable.

    "description": "The status that is to be matched with the input packet. The only bits relevant to this match algorithm are those that have the corresponding filterPktStatusMask bit equal to one. The following two rules are then applied to every packet: (1) For each relevant bit from the packet status with the corresponding filterPktStatusNotMask bit set to zero, if the bit from the packet status is not equal to the corresponding bit from the filterPktStatus, then the packet will fail this status match. (2) If for every relevant bit from the packet status with the corresponding filterPktStatusNotMask bit set to one, the bit from the packet status is equal to the corresponding bit from the filterPktStatus, then the packet will fail this status match. Any packets that have not failed either of the two matches above have passed this status match. In particular, a zero length status filter will match any packet's status. The value of the packet status is a sum. This sum initially takes the value zero. Then, for each error, E, that has been discovered in this packet, 2 raised to a value representing E is added to the sum. The errors and the bits that represent them are dependent on the media type of the interface that this channel is receiving packets from. The errors defined for a packet captured off of an Ethernet interface are as follows: bit # Error 0 Packet is longer than 1518 octets 1 Packet is shorter than 64 octets 2 Packet experienced a CRC or Alignment error For example, an Ethernet fragment would have a value of 6 (2^1 + 2^2). As this MIB is expanded to new media types, this object will have other media-specific errors defined.
