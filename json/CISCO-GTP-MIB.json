It includes both the GTP signalling and data transfer procedures. GTP is used both on the Gn interface, i.e. the interface between GSN peers with in a PLMN, and the Gp interface between GSN peers in different PLMNs. SGSN is the serving GPRS support node, it responsible for the delivery of data packets from and to the MS within its service area. GGSN is the gateway GPRS support node, it provides interworking with external PDN and is connected with SGSNs via an IP-based GPRS backbone network. The GTP protocol is implemented only by SGSNs and GGSN. A PDP Context is an information set maintained by MS and GSNs which describes the mobile wireless service call or session. A Qos Profile is associated with each PDP context which defines multiple attributes like precedence, delay, reliability, peak throughput and mean throughput. Based on the precedence, delay and mean throughput an user is classified into one of the three Qos classes: Best Effort, Normal and Premium. Mean throughput is measured at the Gi and R reference points in units of octets per second. It specifies the average rate at which data is expected to be transferred across the GPRS network during the remaining lifetime of an activated PDP context. A MAP converting GSN is responsible for converting GTP messages to and from MAP messages. This helps in the communication with HLR.

When Mobile System (MS) wants service, it sends packets to a SGSN with specific APN. 2. SGSN uses the DNS to resolve this APN to the IP address of the GGSN which is the designated as the gateway to this APN. 3. SGSN establishes a path to the GGSN using GTP protocol. 4. The SGSN and GGSN peer maintains path by sending echo request message to each other. If one side fails in echo reply for certain times, the other side will send a trap to NMS. A SGSN can have multiple GGSN as peers, while a GGSN can have multiple SGSN peers, depending on routing path. Moreover, a GSN can have more than one path to a peer, each of which will have a unique port."
