Each definition of a concrete CtsPasswordEncryptionType value must be accompanied by a definition of a textual convention for use with that CtsPasswordEncryptionType. To support future extensions, the CtsPasswordEncryptionType textual convention SHOULD NOT be sub-typed in object type definitions. It MAY be sub-typed in compliance statements in order to require only a subset of these address types for a compliant implementation. Implementations must ensure that CtsPasswordEncryptionType object and any dependent objects (e.g. CtsPassword objects) are consistent. An inconsistentValue error must be generated if an attempt to change an CtsPasswordEncryptionType object would, for example, lead to an undefined CtsPassword value. In particular, CtsPasswordEncryptionType/CtsPassword pairs must be changed together if the encryption type changes. (e.g. from clearText(2) to typeSix(1))."
