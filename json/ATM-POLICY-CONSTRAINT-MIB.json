    "description": "The MIB module for Policy Contraints of ATM Forum Policy Routing. The Policy Constraint MIB is organized as two main tables: the policyConstraintTable and the policyTable. The policyConstraintTable provides the entries that can be referenced by other MIB objects to utilize a policy constraint. Each entry in the table contains a set of up to six pointers into the policyTable. The policyTable specifies the operators of a policy. Associated with the policyTable are the policyNeNscTable and the policyRpNscTable. These two tables contain the lists of NSCs on which the policy operators operate. To create a policy, the management station should first create an associated instance of the row status in a policyEntry, using a value of policyIndex that is not currently in use. The object policyNextPolicyIndex can be read to get an available policyIndex. It must also, either in the same or in successive PDUs, create the associated instances of the Ne-NSC and Rp-NSC lists for the policyIndex. It should also specify the values for the policy operators. Once the appropriate instance of all the configuration objects have been created for the policyEntry, policyRpNscEntry, and the policyNeNscEntry (as appropriate), the row status of the policyEntry should be set to active to activate the policy. The policy constraint table can include pointers to policies that are notReady but they must exist. If such a policy constraint is used for a call establishment request, then that policy is not used in the signaled policy constraint. "
