    "description": "Upon initialization, or upon creation of a row containing an object of this type, and after any successful SET of this value, a GET of this value returns 'y' where y = g^xa MOD p, and where g is the base from usmDHParameters, p is the prime from usmDHParameters, and xa is a new random integer selected by the agent in the interval 2^(l-1) <= xa < 2^l < p-1. 'l' is the optional privateValueLength from usmDHParameters in bits. If 'l' is omitted, then xa (and xr below) is selected in the interval 0 <= xa < p-1. y is expressed as an OCTET STRING 'PV' of length 'k' which satisfies k y = SUM 2^(8(k-i)) PV'i i=1 where PV1,...,PVk are the octets of PV from first to last, and where PV1 <> 0. A successful SET consists of the value 'y' expressed as an OCTET STRING as above concatenated with the value 'z'(expressed as an OCTET STRING in the same manner as y) where z = g^xr MOD p, where g, p and l are as above, and where xr is a new random integer selected by the manager in the interval 2^(l-1) <= xr < 2^l < p-1. A SET to an object of this type will fail with the error wrongValue if the current 'y' does not match the 'y' portion of the value of the varbind for the object. (E.g. GET yout, SET concat(yin, z), yout <> yin). Note that the private values xa and xr are never transmitted from manager to device or vice versa, only the values y and z. Obviously, these values must be retained until a successful SET on the associated object. The shared secret 'sk' is calculated at the agent as sk = z^xa MOD p, and at the manager as sk = y^xr MOD p. Each object definition of this type MUST describe how to map from the shared secret 'sk' to the operational key value used by the protocols and operations related to the object. In general, if n bits of key are required, the author suggests using the n right-most bits of the shared secret as the operational key value.",

Note that this value is not set via the SNMP agent, but may be set via some out of band method, such as the device's configuration file. The manager calculates this value in the same manner and using the same parameter set as the agent does. E.g. it selects a random number 'r', calculates y = g^r mod p and provides 'y' as the public number expressed as an OCTET STRING. See usmDHKickstartMyPublic for details. When this object is set with a valid value during initialization, a row is created in the usmUserTable with the following values: usmUserEngineID localEngineID usmUserName [value of usmDHKickstartSecurityName] usmUserSecurityName [value of usmDHKickstartSecurityName] usmUserCloneFrom ZeroDotZero usmUserAuthProtocol usmHMACMD5AuthProtocol usmUserAuthKeyChange -- derived from set value usmUserOwnAuthKeyChange -- derived from set value usmUserPrivProtocol usmDESPrivProtocol usmUserPrivKeyChange -- derived from set value usmUserOwnPrivKeyChange -- derived from set value usmUserPublic '' usmUserStorageType permanent usmUserStatus active A shared secret 'sk' is calculated at the agent as sk = mgrPublic^r mod p where r is the agents random number and p is the DH prime from the common parameters. The underlying privacy key for this row is derived from sk by applying the key derivation function PBKDF2 defined in PKCS#5v2.0 with a salt of 0xd1310ba6, and iterationCount of 500, a keyLength of 16 (for usmDESPrivProtocol), and a prf (pseudo random function) of 'id-hmacWithSHA1'. The underlying authentication key for this row is derived from sk by applying the key derivation function PBKDF2 with a salt of 0x98dfb5ac , an interation count of 500, a keyLength of 16 (for usmHMAC5AuthProtocol), and a prf of 'id-hmacWithSHA1'. Note: The salts are the first two words in the ks0 [key schedule 0] of the BLOWFISH cipher from 'Applied Cryptography' by Bruce Schnier - they could be any relatively random string of bits. The manager can use its knowledge of its own random number and the agent's public value to kickstart its access to the agent in a secure manner. Note that the security of this approach is directly related to the strength of the authorization security of the out of band provisioning of the managers public value (e.g. the configuration file), but is not dependent at all on the strength of the confidentiality of the out of band provisioning data."
