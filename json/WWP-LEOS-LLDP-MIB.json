A row is considered changed if the value of any object in the row changes or if the row is created or deleted. When sysUpTime is equal to zero, this table shall be empty. One entry exists for each past value of sysUpTime, except that the whole table is purged should sysUpTime wrap. As this basic row is updated new conceptual rows are created (which still share the now updated object values with all other instances). The number of instances which are created is determined by the value of sysUpTime at which the basic row was last updated. One instance will exist for each value of sysUpTime at the last update time for the row. A new timeMark instance is created for each new sysUpTime value. Each new conceptual row will be associated with the timeMark instance which was created at the value of sysUpTime with which the conceptual row is to be associated. By definition all conceptual rows were updated at or after time zero and so at least one conceptual row (associated with timeMark.0) must exist for each underlying (basic) row. See the appendix for further discussion of this variable. Consider the following fooTable: fooTable ... INDEX { fooTimeMark, fooIndex } FooEntry { fooTimeMark TimeFilter fooIndex INTEGER, fooCounts Counter } Should there be two basic rows in this table (fooIndex == 1, fooIndex == 2) and row 1 was updated most recently at time 6, while row 2 was updated most recently at time 8, and both rows had been updated on several earlier occasions such that the deprecated values were 5 and 9 respectively then the following fooCounts instances would exist. fooCounts.0.1 5 fooCounts.0.2 9 fooCounts.1.1 5 fooCounts.1.2 9 fooCounts.2.1 5 fooCounts.2.2 9 fooCounts.3.1 5 fooCounts.3.2 9 fooCounts.4.1 5 fooCounts.4.2 9 fooCounts.5.1 5 fooCounts.5.2 9 fooCounts.6.1 5 fooCounts.6.2 9 fooCounts.7.2 9 -- note that row 1 doesn't exist for fooCounts.8.2 9 -- times 7 and 8"

To facilitate internationalization, this information is represented using the ISO/IEC IS 10646-1 character set, encoded as an octet string using the UTF-8 transformation format described in [RFC2279]. Since additional code points are added by amendments to the 10646 standard from time to time, implementations must be prepared to encounter any code point from 0x00000000 to 0x7fffffff. Byte sequences that do not correspond to the valid UTF-8 encoding of a code point or are outside this range are prohibited. The use of control codes should be avoided. When it is necessary to represent a newline, the control code sequence CR LF should be used. The use of leading or trailing white space should be avoided. For code points not directly supported by user interface hardware or software, an alternative means of entry and display, such as hexadecimal, may be provided. For information encoded in 7-bit US-ASCII, the UTF-8 encoding is identical to the US-ASCII encoding. UTF-8 may require multiple bytes to represent a single character / code point; thus the length of this object in octets may be different from the number of characters encoded. Similarly, size constraints refer to the number of encoded octets, not the number of characters represented by an encoding. Note that when this TC is used for an object that is used or envisioned to be used as an index, then a SIZE restriction MUST be specified so that the number of sub-identifiers for any object instance does not exceed the limit of 128, as defined by [RFC1905]. Note that the size of an SnmpAdminString object is measured in octets, not characters. "
