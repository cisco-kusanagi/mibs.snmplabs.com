Other state transitions are unlikely, but are not forbidden. Not shown are the transitions to the canceled state from the pending, pendingHeld, and processingStopped states. Jobs in the pending, processing, and processingStopped states are called 'active', while jobs in the pendingHeld, canceled, aborted, and completed states are called 'inactive'. Jobs reach one of the three terminal states: completed, canceled, or aborted, after the jobs have completed all activity, and all MIB objects and attributes have reached their final values for the job. These values are the same as the enum values of the IPP 'job- state' job attribute. See Section 3.7.1.2. unknown(2), The job state is not known, or its state is indeterminate. pending(3), The job is a candidate to start processing, but is not yet processing. pendingHeld(4), The job is not a candidate for processing for any number of reasons but will return to the pending state as soon as the reasons are no longer present. The job's jmJobStateReasons1 object and/or jobStateReasonsN (N=2..4) attributes SHALL indicate why the job is no longer a candidate for processing. The reasons are represented as bits in the jmJobStateReasons1 object and/or jobStateReasonsN (N=2..4) attributes. See the JmJobStateReasonsNTC (N=1..4) textual convention for the specification of each reason. processing(5), One or more of: 1. the job is using, or is attempting to use, one or more purely software processes that are analyzing, creating, or interpreting a PDL, etc., 2. the job is using, or is attempting to use, one or more hardware devices that are interpreting a PDL, making mark on a medium, and/or performing finishing, such as stapling, etc., OR 3. (configuration 2) the server has made the job ready for printing, but the output device is not yet printing it, either because the job hasn't reached the output device or because the job is queued in the output device or some other spooler, awaiting the output device to print it. When the job is in the processing state, the entire job state includes the detailed status represented in the device MIB indicated by the hrDeviceIndex value of the job's physicalDevice attribute, if the agent implements such a device MIB. Implementations MAY, though they NEED NOT, include additional values in the job's jmJobStateReasons1 object to indicate the progress of the job, such as adding the jobPrinting value to indicate when the device is actually making marks on a medium and/or the processingToStopPoint value to indicate that the server or device is in the process of canceling or aborting the job. processingStopped(6), The job has stopped while processing for any number of reasons and will return to the processing state as soon as the reasons are no longer present. The job's jmJobStateReasons1 object and/or the job's jobStateReasonsN (N=2..4) attributes MAY indicate why the job has stopped processing. For example, if the output device is stopped, the deviceStopped value MAY be included in the job's jmJobStateReasons1 object. NOTE - When an output device is stopped, the device usually indicates its condition in human readable form at the device. The management application can obtain more complete device status remotely by querying the appropriate device MIB using the job's deviceIndex attribute(s), if the agent implements such a device MIB canceled(7), A client has canceled the job and the server or device has completed canceling the job AND all MIB objects and attributes have reached their final values for the job. While the server or device is canceling the job, the job's jmJobStateReasons1 object SHOULD contain the processingToStopPoint value and one of the canceledByUser, canceledByOperator, or canceledAtDevice values. The canceledByUser, canceledByOperator, or canceledAtDevice values remain while the job is in the canceled state. aborted(8), The job has been aborted by the system, usually while the job was in the processing or processingStopped state and the server or device has completed aborting the job AND all MIB objects and attributes have reached their final values for the job. While the server or device is aborting the job, the job's jmJobStateReasons1 object MAY contain the processingToStopPoint and abortedBySystem values. If implemented, the abortedBySystem value SHALL remain while the job is in the aborted state. completed(9) The job has completed successfully or with warnings or errors after processing and all of the media have been successfully stacked in the appropriate output bin(s) AND all MIB objects and attributes have reached their final values for the job. The job's jmJobStateReasons1 object SHOULD contain one of: completedSuccessfully, completedWithWarnings, or completedWithErrors values. This is a type 2 enumeration. See Section 3.7.1.2."

    "description": "Specifies the type(s) of service to which the job has been submitted (print, fax, scan, etc.). The service type is represented as an enum that is bit encoded with each job service type so that more general and arbitrary services can be created, such as services with more than one destination type, or ones with only a source or only a destination. For example, a job service might scan, faxOut, and print a single job. In this case, three bits would be set in the jobServiceTypes attribute, corresponding to the hexadecimal values: 0x8 + 0x20 + 0x4, respectively, yielding: 0x2C. Whether this attribute is set from a job attribute supplied by the job submission client or is set by the recipient job submission server or device depends on the job submission protocol. With either implementation, the agent SHALL return a non-zero value for this attribute indicating the type of the job. One of the purposes of this attribute is to permit a requester to filter out jobs that are not of interest. For example, a printer operator MAY only be interested in jobs that include printing. That is why the attribute is in the job identification category. The following service component types are defined (in hexadecimal) and are assigned a separate bit value for use with the jobServiceTypes attribute: other 0x1 The job contains some instructions that are not one of the identified types. unknown 0x2 The job contains some instructions whose type is unknown to the agent. print 0x4 The job contains some instructions that specify printing scan 0x8 The job contains some instructions that specify scanning faxIn 0x10 The job contains some instructions that specify receive fax faxOut 0x20 The job contains some instructions that specify sending fax getFile 0x40 The job contains some instructions that specify accessing files or documents putFile 0x80 The job contains some instructions that specify storing files or documents mailList 0x100 The job contains some instructions that specify distribution of documents using an electronic mail system.
