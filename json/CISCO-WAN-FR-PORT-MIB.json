    "description": "The MIB module to create/configure frame relay ports/interfaces. This module contains tables related to frame relay port states and statistics. The frame relay logical port is referred to as 'frame relay port' in this mib. Terminologies Used: Channel : Generically refers to the user access channel across which frame relay data travels. This is also referred to use logical port/interface in this MIB. Within a given T1 or E1 physical line, a channel can be one of the following, depending on how the line is configured. Unchannelized : The Entire T1/E1 line is considered a channel, where: * The T1 line operates at the speed of 1.536 Mbps and is single channel consisting of 24 T1 time slots. * The E1 line operates at the speed of 1.984 Mbps and is single channel consisting of 31 T1 time slots. Channelized: The channel is any one of the N time slots within a given line, where: * The T1 line consists of any one or more channels. Each channel is any one of 24 time slots. * The E1 line consists of one or more channels. Each channel is any one of 31 time slots. Fractional: The T1/E1 channel is one of the following groupings of consecutively or nonconsecutively assigned time slots: * N T1 time slots(N*56/64Kbps where N=1-23 T1 Time slots per FT1 channel. * N E1 time slots(N*64Kbps where N=1-30 Time slots per E1: channel. SVC : Switched Virtual Circuits. SVCs allow access through a Frame Relay Network by setting up a path to the destination endpoints only when the need arises and tearing down the path when it is no longer needed. Refer ITU Q.933 and Q.922 FECN : Forward Explicit Congestion Notification A bit set by a frame relay network to notify an interface device(DTE) that congestion avoidance procedures should be initiated by the receiving device. BECN : Backward Explicit Congestion Notification A bit set by a frame relay network to notify an interface device(DTE) that congestion avoidance procedures should be initiated by the sending device. DE : Discard Eligibility A user-bit set indicating that a frame may be discarded in preference to other frames if congestion occurs, to maintain the committed quality of service within the network. Frames with the DE bit set are considered Be(Excess Burst Size)excess data. Unchannelized Service Modules: Following Service Modules does not support channelized interfaces(i.e supports only unchannelized). FRSM-VHS : FRSM-2T3/2E3, FRSM-HS2/HS2B, FRSM-T3B/E3B For following service modules, ifTable is supported: FRSM-12. "

    "description": "This is the frame relay(logical) port number. For Service Modules, supporting ifTable, this must be the ifIndex value of the frame relay port. The port number value supported depends upon the following for each Service Module: - type(Channelized, Unchannelized, Fractional etc) of physical line and number of physical lines - Number of physical line supported - Limitations due to Service Module Hardware components. Port Number mapping is as follows: (NOTE: All the Supported Service Module information is not provided here). T1(channelized) : 24 Time Slots * Max #Lines Supported. Example: 8 Port Service Module - 1..192(24*8) E1(channelized) : 31 Time Slots * Max #Lines Supported. Example: 8 Port Service Module - 1..248(31*8) T3 Channelized : Example: 2CT3 Service Module: 1-256(Limited by hardware) Unchannelized VHS : Range is 1-2 (T3/E3/HS2/T3B/E3B/HS2B-HSSI) FRSM-HS2B-12IN1 : Range is 1-8 FRSM-12 : same as ifIndex value. With the above convention, Port Number mapping is as follows: T1 Service Module : Range is 1-192. E1 Service Module : Range is 1-248. 2CT3 Service Module : Range is 1-256 NOTE: For other Service Modules(Where ifTable is supported): This value for this object must be same as the ifIndex value for the frame relay port ifTable. The frame relay ports identified by ifType values frameRelayService(44) and frForward(158) are valid for this object. Since, Frame Relay Port table is used for creating entries in ifTable, it sounds odd to specify ifIndex value for this object, even before creating the ifTable entries!. The reason(s) for this is as follows: - There are tables in other frame relay mibs, which are indexed by auxiliary objects(objects which are both specified in the INDEX clause and columnar objects of the same row) whose value is supposed to be same as 'portNum'. These MIBs have been used earlier by NMS Applications for the other product lines(MGX8250, MGX8220 etc). - The same frame relay tables in used in other products has been decided to use in new products(for example MGX8850 with FRSM-12 Service Module). It is a requirement that ifTable must be supported in New Service Modules. If we use ifIndex value of the frame relay port (after creation) in other tables(FR Port Stats, FR R Resource Partition or FR Connection etc), and if ifIndex value is different than 'portNum', then it will break the NMS applications which have been using this MIB with the assumptions that 'portNum' and INDEXes(For example: frResPartPortNum, lmiCnfPortNum, etc) are same. To avoid this confusion, it is required that 'portNum' value must be same as 'ifIndex' of the frame relay port. "
