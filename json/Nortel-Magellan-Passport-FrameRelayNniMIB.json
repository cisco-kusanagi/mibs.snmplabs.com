The chosen default class of routing applies to all outgoing calls established using this DNA, and applies to the packets travelling in both directions on all outgoing calls (local to remote, and remote to local). For incoming calls, the default class of routing is chosen by the calling party (as opposed to DPN, where either end of the call can choose the default routing class). This attribute, if set to a value of normal, indicates that the default class of routing is normal reliability routing. If set to a value of high, then the default class of routing is high reliability routing. High reliability is the standard choice for most DPN and Passport services. It usually indicates that packets are overflowed or retransmitted at various routing levels. Typically high reliability results in duplication and disordering of packets in the network when errors are detected or during link congestion. However, the VC handles the duplication and disordering to ensure that packets are delivered to the DTE properly. For the Frame Relay service, duplication of packets is not desired, in which case, normal reliability may be chosen as the preferred class of routing."

If set to no, then this CUG is not the SIMPLE CUG, but an instance of the SELECTABLE CUG. The attribute 'preferential' is set to no by CAS when a CUG instance is created. If only one CUG instance exists under a DNA, and if this CUG's attributes 'incCalls' and 'outCall' are both set to allowed, then this CUG instance can be changed to a SIMPLE CUG by setting the attribute 'preferential' to yes.

If the procedures attribute is set to autoConfigure, this attribute is se to configuring while adaptive LMI determines which LMI procedures are running on the link.

The migrate escape here (DcComponent::migrateFaxEscape) propagates the old provisioning data under H.01 and H.30 into discardPriority and transferPriority. The rule of the above propagation are: 0 in H.01 is equivalent to discardPriority 0; 1 in H.01 is equivalent to discardPriority 1.

    "description": "This group defines Frame Relay attributes collected by Frame Relay Vc. The purpose of Vc attributes is to aid end users and verification people to understand the Vc internal behavior. This is particularly useful when the network has experienced abnormality and we want to isolate problems and pinpoint trouble spots. Attributes are collected on a per Vc basis. Until a need is identified, statistics are not collected at a processor level. Each attribute is stored in a 32 bit field and is initialized to zero when a Vc enters into the data transfer state. When a PVC is disconnected and then connected again, the attributes will be reset. Attributes cannot be reset through other methods. Frame Relay Vc uses a best effort data packet delivery protocol and a different packet segmentation and combination methods from the General Vc. The Frame Relay Vc uses the same call setup and control mechanism (e.g. the support of non-flow control data packets) as in a General Vc. Most General Vc statistics and internal variables are used in a Frame Relay Vc and are displayed by software developers"

Rate adaptation is a feature that, in periods of congestion, adapts the rate at which the user is allowed to send data into the network to that which the network is able to handle at that time. This pro-active measure of handling congestion optimizes network resources by causing the ingress to discard frames that would otherwise be discarded in the network. If this attribute is set to on, then, at the onset of congestion, the excess information rate (EIR) is reduced to a very low rate. If congestion persists, then the allowed CIR is reduced geometrically by 25% of the current value at that time. The minimum to which CIR can be reduced is 1/16th (6.25%) of the provisioned value. As congestion alleviates, CIR is increased linearly by 6.25% of the provisioned value specified in committedInformationRate. If set to eirOnly, then rate adaptation will only apply to the excess information rate (EIR). At the onset of congestion, the allowed EIR is reduced by 25% of its provisioned value. If congestion persists, EIR is reduced geometrically by 25% of the current value at that time. As congestion alleviates, EIR is gradually increased linearly by 6.25% of the provisioned EIR. If set to cirProportionate, then rate adaptation will also only apply to the excess information rate (EIR). At the onset of congestion the initial allowed EIR is set to a multiple of the provisioned CIR. If congestion persists, the allowed EIR is reduced geometrically by 25% of the current value at that time. As congestion alleviates, EIR is gradually increased linearly by 6.25% of the provisioned EIR. Note that the allowed EIR may be set higher than the provisioned EIR, since it is calculated initially using another parameter, the provisioned CIR. If the allowed EIR at the moment is higher than the provisioned EIR, then the provisioned EIR is used instead. This attribute can only be set to on eirOnly or cirProportionate if rateEnforcement is turned on."

A higher setting therefore tends to favour the protection of the network over the allowed throughput of the user. A lower number indicates a lower sensitivity and therefore a slower reaction to network conditions. A slower reaction time results in a greater amount of user traffic allowed into the network, but can lead to a waste of network bandwidth since the traffic may be discarded at the congested resource. A lower setting therefore tends to favour the allowed throughput of the user over the protection of the network.
