The implementation allows a list of network devices to be set up and polled regularly (or only once) by a variety of protocols. The table can be configured to inform the management station(s) of devices that are not responding to polls or that have started to respond after a period of silence. The minimum effort required to do a single poll is 1. In one packet, write the address and set a3ComPollAction to activate(2). 2. In the next packet, read the a3ComPollReport. The minimum effort required to monitor a device is 1. In one packet, write the address, set a3ComPollAttempts to 1, set a3ComPollCount to 0 and set a3ComPollAction to activate(2). 2. Wait for traps to come in. A row in this table is created by setting any read-write member, indexed by the next available index (a3ComPollNextFreeIndex). This method of creation makes the table very user friendly, although a bit harder to detect racing conditions. The suggested method for racing condition detection is by checking the a3ComPollAddress and a3ComPollOwner objects while the a3ComPollReport object is set to active.
