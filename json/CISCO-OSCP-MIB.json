The wavelength bundle is modeled as a single logical link (identified by coscpBundleIfIndex) with a single control and management channel. This logical link is known as the Optical Supervisory Channel (OSC). At any one time, only one wavelength in the bundle is selected to transmit the OSC control and network management traffic. This link is identified by coscpBundleActivePortId. The wavelength bundle must be created by a manager using the coscpBundleRowStatus object. Once the row has been activated, an interface index is assigned by the agent and shown in coscpBundleIfIndex. This value can then be used by the manager to configure control and management protocols, e.g. to configure the OSC's IP address. Aside from coscpBundleRowStatus, the other objects in the row are read-only, since they reflect the dynamic state of the wavelength bundle as determined by OSCP. The wavelength bundle does not become operational until at least one component link reaches the hello state 'twoWay', i.e., until at least one entry in coscpLinkTable with coscpLinkRemoteSwitchId value equal to the value of coscpBundleRemoteSwitchId and coscpLinkDerivedBundleId value equal to the value of coscpBundleId has coscpLinkHelloState value 'twoWay'. The operational status of the wavelength bundle is indicated by the value of ifOperStatus in the ifEntry with ifIndex value equal to the value of coscpBundleIfIndex."
