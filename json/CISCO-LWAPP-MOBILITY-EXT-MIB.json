    "description": "This MIB is intended to be implemented on all those devices operating as Central Controllers (CC) that terminate the Light Weight Access Point Protocol tunnel from Light-weight LWAPP Access Points. This MIB provides configuration and status information about the 802.11 WLAN mobility. The relationship between CC and the LWAPP APs can be depicted as follows: +......+ +......+ +......+ +......+ + + + + + + + + + CC + + CC + + CC + + CC + + + + + + + + + +......+ +......+ +......+ +......+ .. . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . +......+ +......+ +......+ +......+ +......+ + + + + + + + + + + + AP + + AP + + AP + + AP + + AP + + + + + + + + + + + +......+ +......+ +......+ +......+ +......+ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . +......+ +......+ +......+ +......+ +......+ + + + + + + + + + + + MN + + MN + + MN + + MN + + MN + + + + + + + + + + + +......+ +......+ +......+ +......+ +......+ The LWAPP tunnel exists between the controller and the APs. The MNs communicate with the APs through the protocol defined by the 802.11 standard. LWAPP APs, upon bootup, discover and join one of the controllers and the controller pushes the configuration, that includes the WLAN parameters, to the LWAPP APs. The APs then encapsulate all the 802.11 frames from wireless clients inside LWAPP frames and forward the LWAPP frames to the controller. GLOSSARY Access Point ( AP ) An entity that contains an 802.11 medium access control ( MAC ) and physical layer ( PHY ) interface and provides access to the distribution services via the wireless medium for associated clients. LWAPP APs encapsulate all the 802.11 frames in LWAPP frames and sends it to the controller to which it is logically connected. Basic Service Set Identifier (BSSID) The identifier for the service set comprising of all the 802.11 stations under the control of one coordinating Access Point. This identifier happens to be the MAC address of the dot11 radio interface of the Access Point. The wireless clients that associate with the Access Point get the wired uplink through this particular dot11 interface. Central Controller ( CC ) The central entity that terminates the LWAPP protocol tunnel from the LWAPP APs. Throughout this MIB, this entity also referred to as 'controller'. Light Weight Access Point Protocol ( LWAPP ) This is a generic protocol that defines the communication between the Access Points and the Central Controller. Mobility Oracle (MO) When a Central Controller in the Mobility Group is designated as Mobility Oracle, then all the Mobility Controller's (MC) traffic is tunnelled to it by other Mobility Controllers. Currently, MO resides along with MC but MC can reside in a box without MO. Mobility Controller (MC) When a Central Controller in the Mobility Group is designated as Mobility Controller, then all the Mobile Anchor's traffic is tunnelled to it by other Anchors. Each MC has its own/self mobility agent (MA), but MA can reside in a box without MC. Mobility Agent (MA) The Mobility Agent is an entity residing on the access switch that manages mobility events on the switch, and communicates with the Mobility Controller. Access Points can associate directly with MA. Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Wireless LAN Controller are legacy mobility device which can participate in the new mobility architecture. Mobility Manager The Mobility Manager is the management entity in a mobility controller or mobility agent. Mobile Node ( MN ) A roaming 802.11 wireless device in a wireless network associated with an access point. Anchor MC, Anchor MA Anchor MC or Anchor MA is the mobility entity where a mobile client was first anchored or associated. This is equivalent to home agent (HA). Associated MC, Associated MA Associated MC or Associated MA is the mobility entity where a mobile client roamed and get associated. This is equivalent to foreign agent (FA). It can be local or remote. Mobility Concept by which a Mobile Node can roam from one Access Point to another Access Point, across multiple Central Controllers, without need for repeated authentication. Mobility Group A set of Central Controllers which exchange Mobile Node's authentication information, so that the Mobile Node upon roaming need not re-authenticate. Switch Peer Group (SPG) A set of mobility agents (MAs) form a Switch Peer Group. One or more SPGs are associated with one mobility controller (MC). Traffic between mobility agents within a SPG group goes directly between them - not through their associated MC Mobility Anchor When a Central Controller in the Mobility Group is designated as Mobility Anchor, then all the Mobile Node's traffic is tunnelled to it by other Controllers in the Mobility Group. Guest Tunneling (GT) The concept of designating a Central Controller in the Mobility Group as Mobility Anchor, so that all the Mobile Node's traffic is tunnelled to it by other Controllers in the Mobility Group. Station Management (SMT) This term refers to the internal management of the 802.11 protocol operations by the AP to work cooperatively with the other APs and 802.11 devices in the network. Ethernet over Internet Protocol (EoIP) Ethernet over IP (EoIP) is a protocol that creates an Ethernet tunnel between two routers on top of an IP connection. The EoIP interface appears as an Ethernet interface. Reverse path filtering (RPF) Reverse path filtering (RPF) is a feature provided by most modern Internet Protocol routers, which may be used to reduce the risk of customers attacking other internet hosts. One of the problems network service providers face today is hackers generating packets with fake source IP addresses, a technique known as spoofing. This is often done in order to initiate a denial-of-service attack against another internet host or network. Since the source IP addresses of the incoming packets change, often randomly, and for every packet, the target of such an attack can't easily filter out the attacking packets. However, the source of the attack, i.e. the network service provider of the attacking host, has a simple way to stop such packets from ever leaving its network. A router always knows which networks are reachable via any of its interfaces. By checking the source IP address of all packets coming in via an interface against the networks known to be behind that interface, the router can simply drop packets that aren't supposed to come from there. Hence, reverse path filtering filters packets according to the 'reverse path' to their source IP address. If the path back to the source IP address does not match the path the packet is coming from, it is dropped.

Currently the Mobile Node 'MN1' obtains its IP from the Central Controller 'CC1' with which it first associates via WLAN '1' through Access Point 'AP1'. 'CC1' obtains DHCP address, say 10.16.109.199 for client 'MN1'. Now the client 'MN1' is identified by 10.16.109.199 for furthure communication with the network and the communication happens via 'CC1'. Since, 'CC1' and 'CC2' are in same mobility group, 'CC1' sends the authentication block of 'MN1' to 'CC2'. Central Controller 'CC2' has an associated Access Point 'AP2' which beams WLAN '1' and uses 10.16.105.0 / 255.255.255.0 subnet instead. Next, the Mobile Node 'MN1' moves out of range of 'AP1' and gets in to proximity with 'AP2' and continues to use WLAN '1'. 'CC2' locally authenticates 'MN1' against authentication block shared from 'CC1'. 'CC2' forwards all traffic from 'MN1' to router. This is called WLAN mobility. But hold on, 'CC2' uses 10.16.105.0 / 255.255.255.0 subnet for WLAN '1'. So we have two problems here : a> Traffic of 10.16.109.0 / 255.255.255.0 subnet has to be accessible from 10.16.105.0 / 255.255.255.0 subnet. b> Unneccessary overloading of 10.16.105.0 / 255.255.255.0 subnet by traffic from 10.16.109.0 / 255.255.255.0 subnet. How do we address these issues ?? If an EoIP tunnel can be established between 'CC1' and 'CC2' and 'CC1' sends all traffic bound to 'MN1', 10.16.109.199, on this tunnel to 'CC2', which in turn forwards it to 'MN1', then, above two subnet-problems are resolved. This is called Mobility Anchoring. 'CC1' is the Mobility Anchor and 'CC2' is the 'Foreign' for WLAN '1'. As per the configuration, user creates a MobilityAnchor entry in 'CC2' for WLAN '1' with IP address as 'CC1', i.e. 10.16.109.112. So, when 'MN1' connects to WLAN '1' via 'AP2', then 'CC2' establishes EoIP tunnel with 10.16.109.112 and forwards the packets to 'MN1'. Given the above example, the cLMobilityAnchorEntry on 'CC2' looks like : ------------------------------------------------------------------ | MIB - ATTRIBUTES | ROW#1 | ROW#2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | cLWlanIndex | 1 | | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | cLMobilityExtAnchorAssociatedMCAddressType | ipv4 | | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | cLMobilityExtAnchorAssociatedMCAddress | 10.16.109.112 | | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | cLMobilityExtAnchorStatus | up(4) | | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | cLMobilityExtAnchorRowStatus | active(1) | | ------------------------------------------------------------------ This feature has advantages for both security and load balancing. It can be used to restrict a WLAN to a single subnet, regardless of the MN's entry point into the network. A 'public' or guest WLAN can thus be accessed throughout an enterprise, but still is restricted to a specific subnet. It can also be used to provide some geographic load balancing, since the WLANs can represent a particular section of a building (ie., engineering, marketing). Those groups can be 'anchored' on a particular subnet/switch rather than on the CC of first occurrence (ie., the switch controlling the APs by the front door)."
