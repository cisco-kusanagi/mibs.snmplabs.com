If it is not zero(0), it is the index of another row in this table which describes the parent timeslot to the timeslot associated with this row. A parent timeslot is another timeslot which is carved into smaller timeslots, one of which is this current timeslot. For example, a row in this table describing a VT1.5 always has an outerIndex which identifies a row in this table which describes a VT group. A VT group always has an outerIndex that describes a STS-1. The row describing the STS-1 has an outerIndex which identifies a row describing an OC3 SONET interface or perhaps, in the future, an STS12 within an STS48. Thus this object describes a nesting of timeslots. To continue the previous example: an STS-1 with 28 VT1.5's within it is represented by 36 rows in this table; 28 of which identify and describe each VT1.5. Every 4 VT rows have a corresponding VT group (vtgroup) for a total of 7 more rows. Each of the 4 VT1.5 rows that make up the VT group have an indentical value for outerIndex (index of the VT group row that the VT1.5's are associated). Each of the 7 VT group rows have an identical value in outerIndex (index of the STS-1 row that the VT groups are associated)."
