The change described below in REVISION '200102211234Z' was not legal. o Changing the definition of the ciscoFlashDeviceChangeTrap notification. The original definition of this notification include a 'not-accessible' object (ciscoFlashDeviceIndex). It will instead include the following objects: ciscoFlashDeviceMinPartitionSize ciscoFlashDeviceName Instances of these object will carry the value of ciscoFlashDeviceIndex implicitly in their object identifiers. This change is being made without deprecation of the notification and has the potential to cause problems with existing implementations of the notification on the agent and the manager. o Past versions of the MIB have had a incorrectly formatted REVISION/DESCRIPTION section. That will be corrected in this REVISION. o Past versions of the MIB have not defined a NOTIFICATION-GROUP for the notifications defined by this MIB. That will be corrected in this REVISION by adding ciscoFlashNotifGroup.

For systems that execute code directly out of Flash, the minimum partition size needs to be the bank size. (Bank size is equal to the size of a chip multiplied by the width of the device. In most cases, the device width is 4 bytes, and so the bank size would be four times the size of a chip). This has to be so because all programming commands affect the operation of an entire chip (in our case, an entire bank because all operations are done on the entire width of the device) even though the actual command may be localized to a small portion of each chip. So when executing code out of Flash, one needs to be able to write and erase some portion of Flash without affecting the code execution. For systems that execute code out of DRAM or ROM, it is possible to partition Flash with a finer granularity (for eg., at erase sector boundaries) if the system code supports such granularity. This object will let a management entity know the minimum partition size as defined by the system. If the system does not support partitioning, the value will be equal to the device size in ciscoFlashDeviceSize. The maximum number of partitions that could be configured will be equal to the minimum of ciscoFlashDeviceMaxPartitions and (ciscoFlashDeviceSize / ciscoFlashDeviceMinPartitionSize). If the total size of the flash device is greater than the maximum value reportable by this object then this object should report its maximum value(4,294,967,295) and ciscoFlashDeviceMinPartitionSizeExtended must be used to report the flash device's minimum partition size."

On systems that execute code out of Flash, partitioning is a way of creating multiple file systems in the Flash device so that writing into or erasing of one file system can be done while executing code residing in another file system.

Vpp is required for programming (erasing and writing) Flash. For certain older technology chips it is also required for identifying the chips (which in turn is required to identify which programming algorithms to use; different chips require different algorithms and commands). The purpose of the jumper, on systems where it is available, is to write protect a Flash device. On most of the newer remote access routers, this jumper is unavailable since users are not expected to visit remote sites just to install and remove the jumpers when upgrading software in the Flash device. The unknown(3) value will be returned for such systems and can be interpreted to mean that a programming jumper is not present or not required on those systems. On systems where the programming jumper state can be read back via a hardware register, the installed(1) or notInstalled(2) value will be returned. This object is expected to be used in conjunction with the ciscoFlashPartitionStatus object whenever that object has the readOnly(1) value. In such a case, this object will indicate whether the programming jumper is a possible reason for the readOnly state."

    "description": "The copy command to be executed. Mandatory. Note that it is possible for a system to support multiple file systems (different file systems on different Flash devices, or different file systems on different partitions within a device). Each such file system may support only a subset of these commands. If a command is unsupported, the invalidOperation(3) error will be reported in the operation status. Command Remarks copyToFlashWithErase Copy a file to flash; erase flash before copy. Use the TFTP or rcp protocol. copyToFlashWithoutErase Copy a file to flash; do not erase. Note that this command will fail if the PartitionNeedErasure object specifies that the partition being copied to needs erasure. Use the TFTP or rcp protocol. copyFromFlash Copy a file from flash using the TFTP, rcp or lex protocol. Note that the lex protocol can only be used to copy to a lex device. copyFromFlhLog Copy contents of FLH log to server using TFTP protocol.

The station should then create the associated instance of the row status object. It must also, either in the same or in successive PDUs, create the associated instance of the command and parameter objects. It should also modify the default values for any of the parameter objects if the defaults are not appropriate. Once the appropriate instances of all the command objects have been created, either by an explicit SNMP set request or by default, the row status should be set to active to initiate the operation. Note that this entire procedure may be initiated via a single set request which specifies a row status of createAndGo as well as specifies valid values for the non-defaulted parameter objects. Once an operation has been activated, it cannot be stopped. Once the operation completes, the management station should retrieve the value of the status object (and time if desired), and delete the entry. In order to prevent old entries from clogging the table, entries will be aged out, but an entry will never be deleted within 5 minutes of completing."
