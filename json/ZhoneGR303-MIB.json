The Generic Requirements (GR) document describes Bellcore's view of the overall system functions and performance levels required when a Digital Loop Carrier System (DLC) is integrated into a Local Digital Switch (LDS). It further describes a generic interface, one particular means of interfacing a DLC Remote Digital Terminal (RDT) with the LDS. The proposed overall system requirements for Integrated Digital Loop Carrier (IDLC) systems are expressed in terms of functions, i.e., what the combination of RDT and LDS must do when connected together. These end-to-end system requirements are grouped into functional categories dealing with (1) Customer services, (2) Digital network interfaces, (3) Operations Systems interfaces, (4) Craft interfaces, and (5) Overall system capabilities. These proposed requirements do not specify or imply any specific supplier implementation. They are, therefore, termed generic system requirements."

Each IG is configured manually by an administrator. Each IG entry (row) is indexed by a unique IG name. Where both active and standby Interface Groups exist, the same IG name refers to both the active and standby Interface Group. For all IG entries, the (shelf, slot) is unique. The IG name is an externally visible global name that refers to both the active and standby IGs. IG names are used for call routing and does not change during the IG lifetime. The maximum number of entries or Interface Groups is 'system-wide' and not bounded by a slot or card, but can span multiple cards and shelves. Each Interface Group is associated with the following tables: * augmenting Interface Group Control Channel row * DS1 Line Mapping Table * Line Circuit CRV Table * augmenting IG Statistics Current row * IG Statistics Interval Table * augmenting IG Statistics Total row After creating an IG entry an associated primary DS1 must be created.
