Pate, 'Pseudo Wire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) Architecture' [RFC3985], Martini, L., et al, 'Pseudowire Setup and Maintenance Using the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)' [RFC4447], and Townsley, M., et al, 'Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (Version 3)' [RFC3931]. This MIB module enables the use of any underlying packet switched network (PSN). MIB nodules that will support PW operations over specific PSN types are defined in separate memos. The indexes for this MIB module are also used to index the PSN-specific tables and the PW-specific tables. The PW Type dictates which PW-specific MIB module to use.

    "description": "A row in this table represents a pseudowire (PW) virtual connection across a packet network. It is indexed by pwIndex, which uniquely identifies a singular connection. A row can be created by an operator command from a management plan of a PE, by signaling, or due to auto- discovery process. An operator's command can be issued via a non-SNMP application; in such case, a row will be created implicitly by the agent. The read-create objects in this table are divided into three categories: 1) Objects that MUST NOT be changed after row activation. These are objects that define basic properties of the PW (for example type, destination, etc.). 2) Objects that MAY be changed when the PW is defined as not active. A change of these objects involves re-signaling of the PW or it might be traffic affecting. PW not active is defined as one of the following conditions: a) The pwRowStatus is notInService(2). b) The pwRowStatus is notReady(3). c) The pwAdminStatus is down(2). If the operator needs to change one of the values for an active row, the operator can either set the pwRowStatus to notInService(2) or set pwAdminStatus to down(2). Signaling (or traffic) is initiated again upon setting the pwRowStatus to active(1) or setting the pwAdminStatus to up(1) or testing(3), respectively. 3) Objects that MAY be changed at any time. A PW MAY have an entry in the ifTable in addition to the entry in this table. In this case, a special ifType for PW will be set in the ifTable, and the ifIndex in the ifTable of the PW will be set in the pwIfIndex object in this table. By default, all the read-create objects MUST NOT be changed after row activation, unless specifically indicated in the individual object description. Manual entries in this table SHOULD be preserved after a reboot; the agent MUST ensure the integrity of those entries. If the set of entries of a specific row are found to be inconsistent after reboot, the PW pwOperStatus MUST be declared as notPresent(5). "
