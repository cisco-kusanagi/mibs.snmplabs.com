    "description": "There are two types of features in the system: - Regular features - Optional features The Regular features may or may not need to support the user triggerd control (enabling/disabling). In case the regular features need to support such control, they need to be instrumented in their respective MIBs. The Optional features can be controlled (enabled/ disabled) by the user via CLI/SNMP. The optional features are generally disabled by default. As part of the enabling of such optional feature, the first mandatory step is to explicitly enable the feature using the CLI/SNMP. Following this mandatory step, a feature may require additional feature specific enabling steps similar to the regular features. In addition to the user triggered control, other system specific conditions like licensing may influence the operating state of such optional feature. This MIB module is to facilitate the global level control (enabling/disabling) over the optional features in the system. The disabling of such optional feature using this MIB module would make the feature disabled and the entire feature specific mib objects also unavailable. Glossary of the terms used in this MIB: VSAN - Virtual Storage Area Network, similar to a VLAN. WWN - World Wide Name. Mechanism of identifying devices in Fibre Channel Networks. It is 8 bytes long. AAA - Authentication, Authorization and Accounting FLOGI - Fibre Channel fabric login MDS - Multilayer Director Switch"

This is used to negotiate cryptographic keys for IPsec traffic isns(12) - iSNS (Internet Storage Name Service) server. This provides name service, access control and state change notifications for iSCSI devices ipsec(13) - IPSec security services on the device portTracker(14) - Port Tracker. This allows ports to be brought down and up based on changes in the port states of certain configured (tracked) ports scheduler(15) - Scheduler feature provides jobs to be scheduled at a specified time. A Job is a collection of configuration commands in the device. npiv(16) - Nx_Port ID Virtualization. This is a mechanism by which a N_Port can get more than one Nx_Port_Id from the fibre channel (FC) fabric sanExtTuner(17) - SAN Extension Tuner. This is a tool used to generate and analyze SCSI workloads across the FCIP tunnels. This can be used to tune the FCIP tunnels for desired throughput. dpvm(18) - Dynamic Port Vsan Membership. This manages allocation of VSAN to a port based on the device WWN at the time of device FLOGI extenedCredit(19) - Extended Credit feature. This provides a way to increase the receive buffer to buffer credits on physical FC Ports cloudDiscovery(20)- This feature provides grouping functionality of all the IP networks connected to the various gigabit ethernet interfaces in a 'Fabric' isis(21) - IS-IS Unicast Routing Protocol ospf(22) - Open Shortest Path First Unicast Routing Protocol ospfV3(23) - Open Shortest Path First Version 3 Unicast Routing Protocol rip(24) - Routing Information Protocol bgp(25) - Border Gateway Protocol pim(26) - Protocol Independent Multicast igmp(27) - Internet Group Management Protocol msdp(28) - Multicast Source Discovery Protocol pim6(29) - Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) for IPv6 eigrp(30) - Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol sdv(31) - SAN Device-Virtualization Manager cluster(32) - This feature provides a common infrastructure for distributed applications running on multiple switches. It provides consistency and replication of application metadata. It also handles membership and quorum service. sme(33) - SME Daemon lacp(34) - Link Aggregation Control Protocol amt(35) - Auto-Multicast Tunneling dot1x(36) - DOT1X Daemon npv(37) - FC N_port Multiplexer allows multiple end-devices on a switch which does not require a domain_ID to login to a NPIV-capable switch and thereby communicate with other devices in the fabric. l2nac(38) - L2NAC Daemon glbp(39) - Gateway Load Balancing Protocol. This protocol provides support for gateway redundancy and in load balancing traffic. dhcpSnooping(40) - Handles dhcp snooping, IP source guard and Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) functionality. hsrp(41) - The Hot Standby Router Protocol, HSRP, provides a mechanism which is designed to support non-disruptive failover of IP traffic in certain circumstances. In particular, the protocol protects against the failure of the first hop router when the source host cannot learn the IP address of the first hop router dynamically. svi(42) - Switch Virtual Interface Manager vmm(43) - Virtual Module Manager pvlan(44) - Private Vlan Manager tunnelManager(45) - Tunnel manager manages tunnel interfaces which includes creation, configuration and deletion of a tunnel interface. ethPortSec(46) - Ethernet Port Security provides a MAC based security feature for L2 ports. lisp(47) - Locator ID Separation Protocol trustSec(48) - Cisco TrustSec.
