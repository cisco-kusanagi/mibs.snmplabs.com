    "description": "This MIB module is used to create and monitor cross-connects (horizontal relationships) between peer interfaces on the same network element. Vertical relationships (e.g. between lambdas and the optical fiber in which the lambdas are carried) are represented in the ifStackTable from the IF-MIB. This MIB can be used to model various types of cross-connects between peer interfaces, including time-division (e.g. SDH/SONET, PDH), wavelength (lambda), and spatial switching (e.g. incoming port or fiber to outgoing port or fiber). This MIB does not apply to cross-connects between packet flows (e.g. packets in the same forwarding equivalence class at a MPLS-capable switch or router) or cell flows (e.g. ATM Virtual Path connections or ATM Virtual Channel connections), since there are scalability issues in modeling each packet flow or cell flow as a logical interface. The switching element performing the cross-connect function can be electrical (e.g. SDH/SONET switch) or optical (e.g. passive optical add/drop multiplexer) Cross-connects can be created through provisioning, automatically by the network element, or dynamically by using control protocols (e.g. GMPLS). The cross-connect model includes support for pairs of interfaces used to protect each other (e.g. SONET 1+1 Automatic Protection Switching). Cross-connects to protection interfaces may be shown in this MIB module."

Each entry in the table models two bi-directional interfaces on opposite sides of a bi-directional cross-connect. For a point-to-point cross-connect, there can be up to four entries in the table with the same value of coifccCcIndex, due to the presence of protection interfaces. All four entries are associated with each other due to APS configuration (for now, this would be done through the CISCO-APS-MIB). If both sides A and B are configured for 1+1 APS protection, and a cross-connect between interfaces A and B is created, then the following cross-connect entries will be present: The cross-connect with coifccCcKind value 'provisioned' is the one that is created through cross-connect configuration and the cross-connects with coifccCcKind value 'protection' are those that are created automatically due to APS configuration. Low interface High interface coifccCcKind A B provisioned A B' protection A' B protection A' B' protection When the cross-connect between A and B is deleted, all four cross-connect entries will disappear. Each side of the point-to-point cross-connect can have up to two interfaces, for example when SONET 1+1 Automatic Protection Switching (APS) is used. Any one of the four entries of a point-to-point cross-connect can be created, and the remaining three entries will be created automatically. However only the 'provisioned' entry can be explicitly deleted, which also causes the corresponding 'protection' entries to be deleted. Note that use of the word 'protection' is different from its usage in SONET 1+1 APS. In particular, there is no requirement that the 'provisioned' cross-connect must be between the SONET 'working' interfaces. A point-to-multipoint connection consists of one root and many leaves. Copies of the traffic received at the root interface are transmitted out each of the leaf interfaces. For a point-to-multipoint cross-connect with N leafs, the manager creates N 'provisioned' entries in this table. Where N is determined by the manager based on some application. In the presence of APS configuration, the same point-to-multipoint (N leafs) cross-connect, in addition to having N 'provisioned' entries in this table, can have upto an additional 3N 'protection' entries automatically configured. The terms low and high are chosen to represent numerical ordering of the two interfaces associated with a cross-connect. That is, the interface with the lower value of ifIndex is termed 'low', while the other interface associated with the cross-connect is termed 'high'. This terminology is used to provide directional information; for example, the coifccCcL2HOperStatus applies to the low->high direction, and coifccCcH2LOperStatus applies to the high->low direction."

    "description": "This entry is used to model two bi-directional cross-connected interfaces. Cross-connects can be created through provisioning, automatically by the network element, dynamically by using control protocols (e.g. GMPLS), or due to the presence of protection interfaces. When creating an entry through provisioning, the following procedures are used to cross-connect two interfaces: (1) The manager obtains a unique coifccCcIndex by reading the coifccCcIndexNext object. (2) Next, the manager creates a set of one or more rows in the Cross Connect Table. For a point-to-point connection, one row is created by the manager. For a point-to-multipoint connection, one row is created for each leaf to an unprotected interface, or one row is created for each leaf to a pair of protected interfaces. Additional rows for protection interfaces are created automatically by the agent. Each row is indexed by the ifIndex values of the two interfaces at the ends of that cross-connection. This set of rows is identified by a single value of coifccCcIndex. As each row is created, the agent checks if the requested topology is supported and also checks for internal errors in building the cross-connect. The coifccIfCrossConnectIdentifier values in the corresponding coifccInterfaceTable rows are filled in by the agent at this point. The traffic flow is turned on when the manager sets coifccCcRowStatus to active(1) or createAndGo(4). A cross-connect identified by a particular value of coifccCcIndex is released by setting coifccCcRowStatus of all rows identified by this value of coifccCcIndex, other than the rows with a coifccCcKind value of 'protection', to destroy(6). The agent may release associated resources, and the coifccIfCrossConnectIdentifier values in the corresponding coifccInterfaceTable are removed. Note that a situation when only a subset of the associated rows are deleted corresponds to a topology change. At the discretion of the agent, a cross-connect may be reconfigured by adding and/or deleting leafs to/from the topology as per the cross-connect establishment/retirement guidelines described below. Each leaf is added by creating a row with the same value of coifccCcIndex in this table. Each leaf is deleted by deleting a row with the same value of coifccCcIndex in the table. To delete an entire point-to-multipoint connection, all entries with the same coifccCcIndex value must be deleted."
