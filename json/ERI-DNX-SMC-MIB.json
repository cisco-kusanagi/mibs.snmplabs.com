Each alarm type has a code that sets the trap as active and a corresponding code that clears the trap to simulate an alarm. The event type codes are have the prefix 'evnt' but also occur at the start of and end of the event. Each Type code has base number that represents the resource type followed by the bit number from the resource extended device state. Each event or alarm will have a trap for the start equal to the bit number plus the base number and then a trap at the end of the event/alarm equal to the bit number plus the base number plus 40. For example, clearSlotMissing(142) represents a SLOT resource which has a base 100, bit 2 for slot missing, plus 40 to signify the end of the alarm. The exception to this is General Events such as evntColdStart (1)."
