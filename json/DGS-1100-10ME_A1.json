Note, however, that 802.1D-1990 specifies a settable granularity of no more than 1 second for these timers. To avoid ambiguity, a data type is defined here as a textual convention and all representation of these timers in this MIB module are defined using this data type.

    "description": "The status of a table entry. Setting this object to the value invalid(4) has the effect of invalidating the corresponding entry. That is, it effectively disassociates the mapping identified with said entry. It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table. Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to receive tabular information from agents that corresponds to entries currently not in use. Proper interpretation of such entries requires examination of the relevant RmonStatus object. An existing instance of this object cannot be set to createRequest(2). This object may only be set to createRequest(2) when this instance is created. When this object is created, the agent may wish to create supplemental object instances with default values to complete a conceptual row in this table. Because the creation of these default objects is entirely at the option of the agent, the manager must not assume that any will be created, but may make use of any that are created. Immediately after completing the create operation, the agent must set this object to underCreation(3). When in the underCreation(3) state, an entry is allowed to exist in a possibly incomplete, possibly inconsistent state, usually to allow it to be modified in multiple PDUs. When in this state, an entry is not fully active. Entries shall exist in the underCreation(3) state until the management station is finished configuring the entry and sets this object to valid(1) or aborts, setting this object to invalid(4). If the agent determines that an entry has been in the underCreation(3) state for an abnormally long time, it may decide that the management station has crashed. If the agent makes this decision, it may set this object to invalid(4) to reclaim the entry. A prudent agent will understand that the management station may need to wait for human input and will allow for that possibility in its determination of this abnormally long period. An entry in the valid(1) state is fully configured and consistent and fully represents the configuration or operation such a row is intended to represent. For example, it could be a statistical function that is configured and active, or a filter that is available in the list of filters processed by the packet capture process. A manager is restricted to changing the state of an entry in the following ways: To: valid createRequest underCreation invalid From: valid OK NO OK OK createRequest N/A N/A N/A N/A underCreation OK NO OK OK invalid NO NO NO OK nonExistent NO OK NO OK In the table above, it is not applicable to move the state from the createRequest state to any other state because the manager will never find the variable in that state. The nonExistent state is not a value of the enumeration, rather it means that the entryStatus variable does not exist at all. An agent may allow an entryStatus variable to change state in additional ways, so long as the semantics of the states are followed. This allowance is made to ease the implementation of the agent and is made despite the fact that managers should never exercise these additional state transitions."

If the system hosting LLDP agent is not an IEEE 802.1D or an IEEE 802.1Q bridge, the LldpPortNumber will have the same value as the corresponding interface's InterfaceIndex object. Port numbers should be in the range of 1 and 4096 since a particular port is also represented by the corresponding port number bit in LldpPortList."

    "description": "To be used for the index to a table. Allows an application to download only those rows changed since a particular time. Note that this is not a history mechanism. Only current values of underlying objects are returned; saved instance values associated with particular values of sysUpTime are not. An entry is considered changed if the value of any object in the entry changes, if the row is created, or if any object in the entry is created or deleted. Note that deleted entries cannot be detected or downloaded. A time-filtered conceptual table is created by inserting a single object of SYNTAX TimeFilter as the first INDEX component in a copy of an existing basic conceptual table (i.e., any SEQUENCE without a TimeFilter INDEX component). Thus, for each conceptual entry 'I' in the basic table, there exists N conceptual entries in the time-filtered version, indexed N.I, where 'N' is equal to the value of sysUpTime. When an application retrieves conceptual instances from a time-filtered table, and an INDEX value is provided for the TimeFilter INDEX component 'N', the agent will only consider returning basic conceptual entries (e.g., 'fooColumn.N.I') if any column within the basic conceptual entry has changed since sysUpTime 'N'. If not, the basic conceptual entry will be ignored for the particular retrieval operation. When sysUpTime is equal to zero, this table shall be empty. One conceptual entry exists for each past value of sysUpTime, except that the whole table is purged should sysUpTime wrap. As an entry in a time-filtered table is updated (i.e., one of the columns in the basic conceptual table is changed), new conceptual entries are also created in the time-filtered version (which still shares the now updated object values with all other instances). The number of unique time-filtered instances that are created is determined by the value of sysUpTime at which the basic entry was last updated. One unique instance will exist for each value of sysUpTime at the last update time for the row. However, a new TimeFilter index instance is created for each new sysUpTime value. The TimeFilter index values not associated with entry updates are called duplicate time-filtered instances. After some deployment experience, it has been determined that a time-filtered table is more efficient if the agent stops a MIB walk operation by skipping over rows with a TimeFilter index value higher than the value in the received GetNext/GetBulk request. That is, instead of incrementing a TimeFilter index value, the agent will continue to the next object or table. As a consequence, GetNext or GetBulk operations will provide only one pass through a time-filtered table. It is suggested that an agent implement a time-filtered table in this manner to improve performance and avoid a MIB walk getting stuck in time-filtered tables. It is, however, still acceptable for an agent to implement a time-filtered table in the traditional manner (i.e., every conceptual time-filtered instance is returned in GetNext and GetBulk PDU responses), and management applications must be able to deal with such traditional implementations. See the appendix for further discussion of this textual convention. The following example is provided to demonstrate TimeFilter behavior: Consider the following basic conceptual table, basicFooTable. (Note that the basic version of a time-filtered table may not actually be defined.) basicFooTable: basicFooTable ... INDEX { fooIndex } BasicFooEntry { fooIndex Integer32, fooCounts Counter32 } For this example, the basicFooTable contains two static conceptual entries (fooIndex equals '1' and '2'), created at time zero. It also contains one dynamic conceptual entry (fooIndex equals '3'), which is created at time '3' and deleted at time '7'. The time-filtered version of the basicFooTable could be defined as follows: FooTable: fooTable ... INDEX { fooTimeMark, fooIndex } FooEntry { fooTimeMark TimeFilter, fooIndex Integer32, fooCounts Counter32 } Note that entries exist in the time-filtered conceptual table only if they actually exist in the underlying (basic) table. For this example, the fooTable will have three underlying basic entries (fooIndex == 1, 2, and 3), with the following activity (for sysUpTime equal 0 to 9): - fooEntry.N.1 is created at time '0' and most recently updated at time '6' to the value '5'. - fooEntry.N.2 is created at time '0' and most recently updated at time '8' to the value '9'. - fooEntry.N.3 is created at time '3', updated at time '5' to the value '17', and deleted at time '7'. The following tables show the values that would be returned for MIB walk operations with various TimeFilter values, done at different times. An application issues a retrieval request at time 'T', with a TimeFilter value, 'N' (typically set to a lower value, such as the value of sysUpTime at the last polling cycle). The following values would be returned in a MIB walk of fooCounts.N if T equals '0' and N equals '0': fooCounts.N.I Value ========================== fooCounts.0.1 0 fooCounts.0.2 0 Note that nothing is returned for fooCounts.0.3, since that entry does not exist at sysUpTime equals '0'. The following values would be returned in a full (traditional) MIB walk of fooCounts.N if T equals '3' and N equals '0': fooCounts.N.I Value ======================= fooCounts.0.1 0 fooCounts.0.2 0 fooCounts.0.3 0 fooCounts.1.3 0 fooCounts.2.3 0 fooCounts.3.3 0 Note that there are no instances for T equals 1 or 2 for the first two values of N, as these entries did not change since they were created at time '0'. Note that the current value for 'fooCounts.N.3' is returned here, even for values of N less than '3' (when the entry was created). The agent only considers the current existence of an entry in the TimeFilter algorithm, not the time when the entry was created. Note that the instances 'fooCounts.0.3', 'fooCounts.1.3', and 'fooCounts.2.3' are duplicates and can be suppressed by the agent in a MIB walk. The following values would be returned in a full (traditional) MIB walk of fooCounts.N if T equals '6' and N equals '3': fooCounts.N.I Value ======================= fooCounts.3.1 5 fooCounts.3.3 17 fooCounts.4.1 5 fooCounts.4.3 17 fooCounts.5.1 5 fooCounts.5.3 17 fooCounts.6.1 5 Note that no instances for entry 'fooCounts.N.2' are returned, since it has not changed since time '3'. Note that all instances except 'fooCounts.5.3' and 'fooCounts.6.1' are duplicates and can be suppressed by the agent in a MIB walk. The following values would be returned in a full (traditional) MIB walk of fooCounts.N if T equals '9' and N equals '6': fooCounts.N.I Value ======================= fooCounts.6.1 5 fooCounts.6.2 9 fooCounts.7.2 9 fooCounts.8.2 9 Note that no instances for entry 'fooCounts.N.3' are returned, since it was deleted at time '7'. Note that instances 'fooCounts.6.2' and 'fooCounts.7.2' are duplicates and can be suppressed by the agent in a MIB walk."

Section 8.2.1.3 (10BASE-5) and section 10.3.1.3 (10BASE-2) of IEEE standard 802.3 states that a station must detect a collision, in the receive mode, if three or more stations are transmitting simultaneously. A repeater port must detect a collision when two or more stations are transmitting simultaneously. Thus a probe placed on a repeater port could record more collisions than a probe connected to a station on the same segment would. Probe location plays a much smaller role when considering 10BASE-T. 14.2.1.4 (10BASE-T) of IEEE standard 802.3 defines a collision as the simultaneous presence of signals on the DO and RD circuits (transmitting and receiving at the same time). A 10BASE-T station can only detect collisions when it is transmitting. Thus probes placed on a station and a repeater, should report the same number of collisions. Note also that an RMON probe inside a repeater should ideally report collisions between the repeater and one or more other hosts (transmit collisions as defined by IEEE 802.3k) plus receiver collisions observed on any coax segments to which the repeater is connected."

NMS polls all tables associated with remote systems and keeps a local copy of the information retrieved. NMS polls periodically the values of the following objects: a. lldpStatsRemTablesInserts b. lldpStatsRemTablesDeletes c. lldpStatsRemTablesDrops d. lldpStatsRemTablesAgeouts e. lldpStatsRxPortAgeoutsTotal for all ports. 2. LLDP agent updates remote systems MIB objects, and sends out notifications to a list of notification destinations. 3. NMS receives the notifications and compares the new values of objects listed in step 1. Periodically, NMS should poll the object lldpStatsRemTablesLastChangeTime to find out if anything has changed since the last poll. if something has changed, NMS will poll the objects listed in step 1 to figure out what kind of changes occurred in the tables. if value of lldpStatsRemTablesInserts has changed, then NMS will walk all tables by employing TimeFilter with the last-polled time value. This request will return new objects or objects whose values are updated since the last poll. if value of lldpStatsRemTablesAgeouts has changed, then NMS will walk the lldpStatsRxPortAgeoutsTotal and compare the new values with previously recorded ones. For ports whose lldpStatsRxPortAgeoutsTotal value is greater than the recorded value, NMS will have to retrieve objects associated with those ports from table(s) without employing a TimeFilter (which is performed by specifying 0 for the TimeFilter.) lldpStatsRemTablesDeletes and lldpStatsRemTablesDrops objects are provided for informational purposes."

For example, if an entry were to receive data from interface #1, this object would be set to ifIndex.1. The statistics in this group reflect all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. An agent may or may not be able to tell if fundamental changes to the media of the interface have occurred and necessitate an invalidation of this entry. For example, a hot-pluggable ethernet card could be pulled out and replaced by a token-ring card.

The statistics in this group reflect all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface.

Each bit of this bit mask specifies whether or not the corresponding sub-identifiers must match when determining if an OBJECT IDENTIFIER is in this family of view subtrees; a '1' indicates that an exact match must occur; a '0' indicates 'wild card', i.e., any sub-identifier value matches. Thus, the OBJECT IDENTIFIER X of an object instance is contained in a family of view subtrees if, for each sub-identifier of the value of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree, either: the i-th bit of vacmViewTreeFamilyMask is 0, or the i-th sub-identifier of X is equal to the i-th sub-identifier of the value of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree. If the value of this bit mask is M bits long and there are more than M sub-identifiers in the corresponding instance of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree, then the bit mask is extended with 1's to be the required length. Note that when the value of this object is the zero-length string, this extension rule results in a mask of all-1's being used (i.e., no 'wild card'), and the family of view subtrees is the one view subtree uniquely identified by the corresponding instance of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree. Note that masks of length greater than zero length do not need to be supported. In this case this object is made read-only. "
