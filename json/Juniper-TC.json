A GET of this object returns the next available ifIndex value to be used to create an entry in the associated interface table; or zero, if no valid ifIndex value is available.

Successive GETs will typically return different values, thus avoiding collisions among cooperating management clients seeking to create table entries simultaneously.

One approach is to identify such interfaces with a 2-tuple consisting of <IpAddress, ifIndex>, where only one of the pair is nonzero for a valid interface (IpAddress is nonzero for numbered interfaces, ifIndex is nonzero for unnumbered interfaces). As an alternative, this textual convention compresses the 2-tuple information into an IpAddress (32-bit) format a.b.c.d having the following interpretation: Format Interpretation IP Interface Type ------------------------------------------------------------------ 0.0.0.0 'null' value 'none' or 'wildcard', etc. a.b.c.d, a != 0 IP Address Numbered 0.b.c.d ifIndex Unnumbered For the unnumbered case, the value of the ifIndex is given by (b * 65536) + (c * 256) + (d) A side-effect of this approach is that ifIndex values for IP network interfaces must fall in the range 1..16777215 (i.e. 24 bits)."

A 1 in a bit position indicates the corresponding table entry object has been explicitly configured. A 0 in a bit position indicates the corresponding table entry has NOT been explicitly configured (and typically contains the default setting defined in the DEFVAL clause for that object). Once set, a bit typically remains set until the table entry is destroyed. The semantics of an object of this type should specify by what circumstances, if any, bits in the map may be cleared. If an entry exists in a table but no entry objects have been configured, JuniSetMap will contain a zero-length string. The DESCRIPTION clause for an object having this SYNTAX should indicate which, if any, entry objects are excluded from representation in the JuniSetMap. Typically, index and RowStatus entry objects would not be represented. Bit positions correspond to table entry objects as follows: Objects in the table entry are numbered according to the last OID subidentifier of their object type as defined in the MIB. For example, an object in a table entry having OID 1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.5 would be object number 5. (Instance-identifying OID subidentifiers are ignored.) Octets in the map are numbered 1..N beginning with the first octet. Bits in an octet are numbered 1..8 beginning with the MOST significant bit. Bit B in octet Q represents the entry object numbered E thus: E = (((Q - 1) * 8) + B) For example, the third most significant bit in the second octet represents the entry object numbered 11: ((((2 - 1) * 8) + 3) = 11 Conversely, the octet Q and bit B positions of the corresponding bit for a given entry object numbered E is determined by: Q = (((E - 1) / 8) + 1) (where '/' means integer division) B = (((E - 1) modulo 8) + 1) For example, the octet and bit positions of the entry object numbered 11 are: (((11 - 1) / 8) + 1) = 2 (octet number) (((11 - 1) modulo 8) + 1) = 3 (3rd most sig. bit) "
