Telepresence refers to a set of technologies which allow a person to feel as if they were present, to give the appearance that they were present, or to have an effect, at a location other than their true location. Telepresence call is an audio-video call; however, some Telepresence systems also support audio addin call. Different security levels are supported in some Telepresence systems; security level may be specified from call management system. Some Telepresence systems support Telepresence meeting, the agent of the corresponding systems may also support CISCO-TELEPRESENCE-MEETING-MIB."
