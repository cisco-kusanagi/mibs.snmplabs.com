All the bits are transported unmodified with preserved timing information. The following services are all regarded as ITS: - PDH primary rates - Video (DVB/SD-SDI/HD-SDI) - Audio (AES-EBU) - SDH transport The MIB includes three primary conceptual tables; for configuring the trail termination points on the originating (source) and terminating (sink) side of the connection, and for configuring the interfaces. The table itsSrcTtpTable defines the trail termination points for the originating (source) side. The table itsSnkTtpTable defines the trail termination points for the terminating (sink) side. The table itsIfTable defines the interfaces. In addition to the itsIfTable, there are dedicated tables for technology specific configuration objects. The interconnection between the trail termination points shall be done through configuration in the Channel Manager MIB (NETI-CHMGR-MIB). A bi-directional connections are handled by creating two uni-directional connections, one in each direction, between the trail termination points."
