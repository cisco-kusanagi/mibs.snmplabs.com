The default (normal) is to automatically choose a route with Route Selection. Normal pathTypes require less provisioning and can dynamically handle path failures. The other pathTypes are both manual pathTypes where the operator must specify, through provisioning, a static route termed the manualPath. A manual pathType connection is nearly identical to a normal path type connection with the exception that the route is pre-provisioned. For a manual pathType, bandwidth reservations are respected along the path exactly as in a normal path. The last type, the forced pathType, is also a manual path but regardless of the bandwidth available the route is granted provided the trunks are operational and there are sufficient Logical Channels (LChs). The forced pathType could result in over committing the reserved bandwidth allowed on a trunk. A better way to achieve the effects of a forced pathType is to use a manual pathType with setupPriority = 0 and holdingPriority = 0. In this manner the path will reserve correct bandwidth and it will bump other paths if required while not being bumped itself."

A related path attribute, the pathType, determines if this route will be used as a manual or forced path type. As an example, the trunk component name for the third trunk on node MoonBase is 'EM/MoonBase Trk/3'. Note that only the first end of the trunk that the packet would encounter is provisioned. These strings are case insensitive but the complete component name must be input. Note 1: the trunk designation must be a 3-letter form, e.g., 'trk'. Note 2: only the outbound trunks component names are used to provision the manualPath. Note 3: It is recommended to have two independent routes specified for a manual path by specifying a different manualPath (non-symmetric) for each end. In this case, there is no way to select which route will be used (first up wins) but if one path is torn down due to a failure then the other manualPath may be used to reroute the path."

For a manual pathType, bandwidth reservations are respected along the path exactly as in a normal path. The last type, the forced pathType, is also a manual path but regardless of the bandwidth available the route is granted provided the trunks are operational and there are sufficient Logical Channels (LChs). The forced pathType could result in over committing the reserved bandwidth allowed on a trunk.

    "description": "This attribute reflects the last tear down reason for a connection (LCo). In many cases this displays the reason for a momentary service interruption. This attribute applies to the last path failure only. If a path is no longer up, this may give an indication to the reason that the path has failed. In many cases an alarm will also be generated with more specific information. The following is a brief description of the reasons: none - This path has no information for the teardown this is typical of a path provisioned with no remoteName that has not been up. normalShutDown - This path has gone down due to normal call termination. insufficientTxLcOrBandwidth - At present there is either no available bandwidth or logical channel numbers available on one or more of the trunks for this path in the transmit direction. insufficientRxLcOrBandwidth - At present there is either no available bandwidth or logical channel numbers available on one or more of the trunks for this path in the receive direction. trunkFailure- A trunk on the path has failed or has gone down due to a provisioning change of a critical attribute. trunkCardFailure- A trunk FP card has failed along the path. accessCardFailure- The FP on which the peer access service was running has failed. operatorForced- The path has terminated due to the operator locking a trunk along the path. lostLcnClash- The path has terminated because the PA's at both ends of an intermediate trunk have allocated the same LC to different calls. When this happens both calls must go down and then try to come up again a fraction of a second later (effectively ensuring that they will now be assigned different LC's). It is normal to get the odd clash especially when the PA's usedLC is approaching the PA's maxLC. networkCongestion - The path has failed due to control information being lost and not recoverable. trunkNotFound - Occurs on a manual path usually. Check for trunks not up or names provisioned incorrectly. farEndNotFound - The far end is not provisioned or is not up. Check remote Name. wrongModuleReached - This may occur on a manual path. Check provisioning for correct trunk and service names. For a normal path, the network Topology may be changing check remoteName. farEndBusy - The far end has been reached but it is busy. Check remoteName and remote end provisioning. callLoopedBack - This LCo is provisioned to call itself. Re- provision since this is invalid. unknownReason - The failure was not resolved. farEndNotReady - The remote end was reached but the connection was refused due to the remote end not being enabled. remoteNameMismatch - The remote end has alarmed and rejected this setup due to remoteName provisioning. serviceTypeMismatch - The remote Service Type does not match this service type. Check provisioning. reconnectFromFarEnd - The remote end re-established this connection. Check the remote end lastTearDownReason to determine the real reason. bumped - Another call bumped this path from a trunk to get bandwidth (or an LC) which it required to come up. This other path had a higher setupPriority than this path's holdingPriority hence it was allowed to steal the bandwidth (or LC) from this path. optimized - This call has been rerouted due to the optimization feature. The call is still active this just indicates why the path changed. trunkOrFarEndDidNotSupportMode - This call was unable to complete because a mode required by the service was not supported by one of the trunks the route went through or by the far end service it connected to. Currently the only mode that this applies to is the map/mux mode on TRUNK PA ATM component. Map mode was required by the application (CES/FrAtm etc.) but was not available on the TRUNK PA ATM component through which the call was routed or the far end CES/FrAtm component did not specify the same mode."

If disconnectConnection is displayed, the application is informed as soon as possible about a failure by disconnection. If the attribute displays reRoutePath, the path may attempt an immediate reroute, provided the failure is a recoverable failure. If rerouting fails the application is informed of the failure. With this option set to reRoutePath the LCo may wait up to 30 seconds before informing the service of complete disconnection in order to allow both ends to attempt to reconnect. Note that if PLC components are different at both ends only the calling end is allowed to reconnect. All pathTypes respect this attribute. Also on a manualPath with both ends provisioned with independent paths (at least with respect to the failure) this option will have the desired effect that the path is rerouted without complete disconnection at both ends"
