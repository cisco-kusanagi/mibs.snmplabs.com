    "description": "The pcomLedProgram string is a sequence of instructions for the LED state. The LED constantly repeats the program. Each LED state is represented by a two octet sequence where the value of the first octet of the pair indicates the color of the LED, and the value of the seconds octet of the pair indicates the duration in which that color will be present. +----------+----------+ --/ /-- +----------+----------+ | Color | Duration | | Color | Duration | +----------+----------+ --/ /-- +----------+----------+ The 'color' octet may have one of the following values: 0 - off 1 - other 2 - red 3 - yellow 4 - green 5 - blue 6 - red-blinking 7 - yellow-blinking 8 - blue-blinking 9 - green-blinking The value 'off' indicates that the led is off. The value 'other' indicates a color not covered by any others in the list. The value of the second octet in each pair indicates the duration in which that color will be present. A value of zero indicates that the LED is off. A value of 0xff indicates that the LED is always on. Values in between 0 and 0xff indicate the duration in 10 ms ticks. A zero length string may be returned if the LED is 'not present'. This indicates that the LED is currently not visible. (This is provided for modules which may attach to different chassis, i.e. an 8-slot chassis or a single-slot chassis, in which a different LEDs may be visible. For example, say an extra three LEDs are visible when the device is inserted in a single-slot chassis. When the device is removed from the single slot chassis and inserted into the 8-slot chassis, these three LEDs may not be visible. Therefore, a zero length string may be returned to indicate that these three LEDs are not present.) Activity LEDs are a special case. Activity LEDs are defined as LEDs which blink whenever data is received on the line. They are typically on solid under heavy activity. Since these LEDs can change rapidly, the following rules apply: o The initial state of activity LEDs is off. o If the line shows activity any time in a 10 second period, then the LED is shown as on. o If the line shown inactivity any time in a 10 second period, then the LED is shown as off. Example: Consider a 4-bank, 12-port repeater: Bank: Ports: ---- ----- Bank A: A1, A2, A3 Bank B: B1, B2, B3 Bank C: C1, C2, C3 Bank D: D1, D2, D3 Which has the following LEDs: LED: pcomLedDescr: pcomLedIndex: --- ------------ ------------ PWR Hub Power On 1 DIAG Diagnostics 2 A Bank Indicator A 3 B Bank Indicator B 4 C Bank Indicator C 5 D Bank Indicator D 6 P1: Port Status 1A/B/C/D 7 P2: Port Status 2A/B/C/D 8 P3: Port Status 3A/B/C/D 9 Assume the ports of this repeater are in the following states: Port: State: ---- ----- 1A Operational, auto-partitioned, media available 2A Not operational 3A Operational, not auto-partitioned, media available 1B Operational, not auto-partitioned, media available 2B Not operational 3B Not operational 1C Operational, not auto-partitioned, media available 2C Operational, auto-partitioned, media available 3C Not operational 1D Operational, auto-partitioned, media available 2D Not operational 3D Operational, auto-partitioned, media available Here are the contents of the pcomLedTable for this example: ledIndex: ledDescr: ledProgram: -------- -------- ---------- 1 Hub Power On 0x04, 0xFF 2 Diagnostics 0x04, 0x32, 0x00, 0x32 3 Bank Indicator A 0x04, 0xC8, 0x00, 0xC8, 0x00, 0xC8, 0x00, 0xC8 4 Bank Indicator B 0x00, 0xC8, 0x04, 0xC8, 0x00, 0xC8, 0x00, 0xC8 5 Bank Indicator C 0x00, 0xC8, 0x00, 0xC8, 0x04, 0xC8, 0x00, 0xC8 6 Bank Indicator D 0x00, 0xC8, 0x00, 0xC8, 0x00, 0xC8, 0x04, 0xC8 7 Port 1A/B/C/D 0x00, 0xC8, 0x04, 0xC8, 0x04, 0xC8, 0x00, 0xC8 8 Port 2A/B/C/D 0x08, 0xC8, 0x08, 0xC8, 0x00, 0xC8, 0x08, 0xC8 9 Port 3A/B/C/D 0x04, 0xC8, 0x08, 0xC8, 0x08, 0xC8, 0x00, 0xC8 This example shows: o LED 1 is green, and always on o LED 2 is blinking at a frequency of 1 Hz (1/2 sec green, 1/2 sec. off) LED's 3-6 indicate for which bank (a-D) of ports status is currently being displayed on LED's 7-9. o LED 3 is on for 2 seconds, then off for 6 seconds o LED 4 is off for 2 seconds, on for 2 seconds, off for 4 seconds o LED 5 is off for 4 seconds, on for 2 seconds, off for 2 seconds o LED 6 is off for 6 seconds, then on for 2 seconds o LED 7 is the status LED for Ports 1A, 1B, 1C and 1D.
