    "description": "This MIB is intended to be implemented on all those devices operating as Central Controllers (CC) that terminate the Light Weight Access Point Protocol tunnel from Cisco Light-weight LWAPP Access Points. This MIB helps to manage the WLANs on the controller. The relationship between CC and the LWAPP APs can be depicted as follows: +......+ +......+ +......+ +......+ + + + + + + + + + CC + + CC + + CC + + CC + + + + + + + + + +......+ +......+ +......+ +......+ .. . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . +......+ +......+ +......+ +......+ +......+ + + + + + + + + + + + AP + + AP + + AP + + AP + + AP + + + + + + + + + + + +......+ +......+ +......+ +......+ +......+ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . +......+ +......+ +......+ +......+ +......+ + + + + + + + + + + + MN + + MN + + MN + + MN + + MN + + + + + + + + + + + +......+ +......+ +......+ +......+ +......+ The LWAPP tunnel exists between the controller and the APs. The MNs communicate with the APs through the protocol defined by the 802.11 standard. LWAPP APs, upon bootup, discover and join one of the controllers and the controller pushes the configuration, that includes the WLAN parameters, to the LWAPP APs. The APs then encapsulate all the 802.11 frames from wireless clients inside LWAPP frames and forward the LWAPP frames to the controller. GLOSSARY Access Point ( AP ) An entity that contains an 802.11 medium access control ( MAC ) and physical layer ( PHY ) interface and provides access to the distribution services via the wireless medium for associated clients. LWAPP APs encapsulate all the 802.11 frames in LWAPP frames and sends it to the controller to which it is logically connected to. Central Controller ( CC ) The central entity that terminates the LWAPP protocol tunnel from the LWAPP APs. Throughout this MIB, this entity also referred to as 'controller'. Light Weight Access Point Protocol ( LWAPP ) This is a generic protocol that defines the communication between the Access Points and the controllers. Mobile Node ( MN ) A roaming 802.11 wireless device in a wireless network associated with an access point. Access Control List ( ACL ) A list of rules used to restrict the traffic reaching an interface or the CPU or WLAN. Each ACL is an ordered set of rules and actions. If a rule matches then the action for that rule is applied to the packet. 802.1x The IEEE ratified standard for enforcing port based access control. This was originally intended for use on wired LANs and later extended for use in 802.11 WLAN environments. This defines an architecture with three main parts - a supplicant (Ex. an 802.11 wireless client), an authenticator (the AP) and an authentication server(a Radius server). The authenticator passes messages back and forth between the supplicant and the authentication server to enable the supplicant get authenticated to the network. Temporal Key Integrity Protocol ( TKIP ) A security protocol defined to enhance the limitations of WEP. Message Integrity Check and per-packet keying on all WEP-encrypted frames are two significant enhancements provided by TKIP to WEP. Cisco Key Integrity Protocol ( CKIP ) A proprietary implementation similar to TKIP. CKIP implements key permutation for protecting the CKIP key against attacks. Other features of CKIP include expansion of encryption key to 16 bytes of length for key protection and MIC to ensure data integrity. Wired Equivalent Privacy ( WEP ) A security method defined by 802.11. WEP uses a symmetric key stream cipher called RC4 to encrypt the data packets. Wi-Fi Protected Access ( WPA ) Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) are security systems created in response to several serious weaknesses found in Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP). WPA implements the majority of the IEEE 802.11i standard, and was intended as an intermediate measure to take the place of WEP while 802.11i was prepared. WPA is designed to work with all wireless network interface cards, but not necessarily with first generation wireless access points. WLAN Layer 2 Security WLAN layer 2 (MAC) security defines the encryption and authentication approaches such as 802.1x, WPA, WPA2, CKIP and WEP. Delivery Traffic Indication Map ( DTIM ) DTIM is measured in beacon intervals and is the time period during which multicast/broadcast packets are sent to clients. This helps client to go in Power Saving mode and helps to save battery power. Network Admission Control (NAC) Cisco NAC uses the network infrastructure to enforce security policy compliance on all devices that seek to access network computing resources. With the Cisco NAC appliance, network administrators can authenticate, authorize, evaluate, and remediate wired, wireless, and remote users and their machines prior to network access. The Cisco NAC appliance identifies whether networked devices such as laptops, IP phones, or game consoles are compliant with network security policies, and repairs any vulnerabilities before it permits access to the network. Out of Band (OOB) Out-of-band deployments require user traffic to traverse through the NAC appliance only within authentication, posture assessment, and remediation. When a user is authenticated and passes all policy checks, the traffic is switched normally through the network and bypasses the NAC server. Band Select The 2.4 GHz band is congested and clients have to contend with numerous performance challenges. These consist of interference from Bluetooth, microwave ovens, cordless phones, etc.; protection mechanisms from 802.11b legacy clients; and co-channel interference from other access points due to 802.11bg?s limit of three non-overlapping channels. Allowing client Wi-Fi radios capable of dual band (2.4 and 5 GHz) operation move to the less congested 5 GHz radios would improve the overall performance of the network. The Band Select algorithm is based on probe response suppression on clients 2.4G radio. The feature is OFF by default and has to be manually switched ON globally for a WLC. It can be optionally over-ridden per-SSID to disallow it. Network Access Identifier ( NAI ) In order to provide roaming services, it is necessary to have a standardized method for identifying users. NAI is actually the user identity submitted by the client during network authentication. KTS (Key Telephone System) Key Telephone System is an alternative to a private branch exchange (PBX)phone system. A KTS is equipped with several buttons that allow a caller to directly select outgoing lines or incoming calls, and use intercom and conference facilities. HALO (Hyperlocation) Hyperlocation is a technique of calculating location using Angle of Arrival(AoA) tracks 802.11 OFDM clients (meaning 802.11a/g/n/ac clients) that are associated(connected) on the network and is able to do so with much higher accuracy than conventional Real Time Location Systems(RTLS) that rely on only RSSI (RF Signal Strength). PakRSSI (Packet Received Signal Strength Indicator) PakRSSI is a measurement of the power present in a received radio signal. POE (Power Over Ethernet) Power over Ethernet or PoE describes any of several standardized or ad-hoc systems which pass electrical power along with data on Ethernet cabling. This allows a single cable to provide both data connection and electrical power to devices such as wireless access points or IP cameras.
