For all Bridges in which the same MAID {dot1agCfmMdFormat, dot1agCfmMdName, dot1agCfmMaNetFormat, and dot1agCfmMaNetName} is configured, the same set of dot1agCfmMaMepListIdentifiers MUST be configured in the Bridges' dot1agCfmMaMepListTables. This allows each MEP to determine whether or not it is receiving CCMs from all of the other MEPs in the MA. For example, if one were creating a new MA whose MAID were {charString, 'Dom1', charString, 'MA1'}, that had 2 MEPs, whose MEPIDs were 1 and 3, one could, in Bridge A: 1. Get a new MD index d from dot1agCfmMdTableNextIndex. 2. Create the Maintenance Domain {charString, 'Dom1'}. 3. Get a new MA index a from dot1agCfmMdMaNextIndex [d]. 4. Create the Maintenance Association {charString, 'MA1'}. 5. Create a new dot1agCfmMaMepListEntry for each of the MEPs in the MA: [d, a, 1] and [d, a, 3]. 6. Create one of the new MEPs, say [d, a, 1]. Then, in Bridge B: 7. Do all of these steps 1-6, except for using the other MEPID for the new MEP in Step 6, in this example, MEPID 3. Note that, when creating the MA, MEP List Table, and MEP entries in the second Bridge, the indices 'd' and 'a' identifying the MAID {charString, 'Dom1', charString, 'MA1'} may have different values than those in the first Bridge.

A MEP is an actively managed CFM entity, associated with a specific DSAP of a Service Instance, which can generate and receive CFM PDUs and track any responses. It is an endpoint of a single Maintenance Association, and is an endpoint of a separate Maintenance Entity for each of the other MEPs in the same Maintenance Association (3.114). This table uses three indices. The first two indices are the indices of the Maintenance Domain and MA tables, the reason being that a MEP is always related to an MA and Maintenance Domain. The MEP table also stores all the managed objects for sending LBM and LTM. *LBM Managed objects LBM Managed objects in the MEP table enables the management entity to initiate transmission of Loopback messages. It will signal the MEP that it SHOULD transmit some number of Loopback messages and detect the detection (or lack thereof) of the corresponding Loopback messages. Steps to use entries in this table: 1) Wait for dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmStatus value to be false. To do this do this sequence: a. an SNMP GET for both SnmpSetSerialNo and dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmStatus objects (in same SNMP PDU). b. Check if value for dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmStatus is false. - if not, wait x seconds, go to step a above. - if yes, save the value of SnmpSetSerialNo and go to step 2) below 2) Change dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmStatus value from false to true to ensure no other management entity will use the service. In order to not disturb a possible other NMS do this by sending an SNMP SET for both SnmpSetSerialNo and dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmStatus objects (in same SNMP PDU, and make sure SNmpSetSerialNo is the first varBind). For the SnmpSetSerialNo varBind, use the value that you obtained in step 1)a.. This ensures that two cooperating NMSes will not step on each others toes. Setting this MIB object does not set the corresponding LBIactive state machine variable. 3) Setup the different data to be sent (number of messages, optional TLVs,...), except do not set dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmMessages. 4) Record the current values of dot1agCfmMepLbrIn, dot1agCfmMepLbrInOutOfOrder, and dot1agCfmMepLbrBadMsdu. 6) Set dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmMessages to a non-zero value to initiate transmission of Loopback messages. The dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmMessages indicates the number of LBMs to be sent and is not decremented as loopbacks are actually sent. dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmMessages is not equivalent to the LBMsToSend state machine variable. 7) Check the value of dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmResultOK to find out if the operation was successfully initiated or not. 8) Monitor the value of dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmStatus. When it is reset to false, the last LBM has been transmitted. Wait an additional 5 seconds to ensure that all LBRs have been returned. 9) Compare dot1agCfmMepLbrIn, dot1agCfmMepLbrInOutOfOrder, and dot1agCfmMepLbrBadMsdu to their old values from step 4, above, to get the results of the test. *LTM Managed objects The LTM Managed objects in the MEP table are used in a manner similar to that described for LBM transmission, above. A SET operation to the variable dot1agCfmMepTransmitLtmFlags triggers the transmission of an LTM. Then, the variables dot1agCfmMepTransmitLtmSeqNumber and dot1agCfmMepTransmitLtmEgressIdentifier return the information required to recover the results of the LTM from the dot1agCfmLtrTable. "
