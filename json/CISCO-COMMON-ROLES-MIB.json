    "description": "MIB module for managing the common roles between access methods like Command Line Interface (CLI), SNMP and XML interfaces. Every user on a device is associated with a role. A user role defines access rights afforded to the users that belog to this role. A role specifies which commands/operations a user is able to perform on what information. SNMP uses VACM (View-based Access Control Model) group to define access rights. Both SNMPv1/v2c community and SNMPv3 user have to belong to a group in order to access information. CLI uses proprietary mechanisms to define the access rights. Most of them depend on the underlying operating system. Groups created from SNMP are not same as the roles created from CLI unless they are synchronized. In addition to this, views make up the roles in VACM where was some kind of internal rules make the roles in the CLI. This MIB describes a framework in which a role defined independent of access methods. It is up to the the particular access method to convert this framework information into the native information. For example, SNMP needs to convert common role framework to VACM. Note that this framework could be also used for any other access methods other than SNMP and CLI. The framework needs a list of features and list of operations they can support. Features provide the data context and are system dependent. Operations are the actions that can be done on the data. The role are defined in terms of rules. Rules are essentially access rights which specify if a certain operation on a feature is permitted or not. An extension to this MIB module has been defined in CISCO-COMMON-ROLES-EXT-MIB to provide support for a framework which has compound features, i.e., features defined as group of other features, and also to provide another option for how a user's access can be restricted."

If it is 'vsan', the two objects commonRoleScope1 and commonRoleScope2 provide the list of Virtual Storage Area Networks (VSANs) which this role can access. The object commonRoleScope1 provides list of VSANs from 0 through 2047 and commonRoleScope2 provides from 2048 through 4095. Each octet within the value of the the two objects specifies a set of eight VSANs. The first octet specifies VSANs 0 through 7 for commonRoleScope1 and VSANs 2048 through 2054 for commonRoleScope2. Similarly, the second octet specifies VSANs 8 through 15 and VSANs 2055 through 2062 for commonRoleScope2, etc. Within each octet, the most significant bit represents the lowest numbered VSAN, and the least significant bit represents the highest numbered VSAN. Thus, each VSAN, is represented by a single bit within the value of this object. A role can access a VSAN if and only if that bit has a value of '1'. If these objects have a value which are less than 256 bytes long, then the VSANs which are not represented are not considered to be in these list. If both the scope objects are zero-length strings, then this role can not access any VSANs if this object is `vsan'. The role can access all the VSANs if the this object is 'none'. Also, both commonRoleScope1 and commonRoleScope2 are invalid if this object is 'none'. Other means of restricting the scope of a role can be defined in the future by extending this object with additional enumerations. Each such addition will define the restriction and any parameters it might have, which might or might not be specified via the corresponding values of commonRoleScope1 and commonRoleScope2."
