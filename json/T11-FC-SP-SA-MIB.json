    "description": "This MIB module specifies the management information required to manage Security Associations established via Fibre Channel's FC-SP specification. The MIB module consists of six parts: - a per-Fabric table, t11FcSpSaIfTable, of capabilities, parameters, status information, and counters; the counters include non-transient aggregates of per-SA transient counters; - three tables, t11FcSpSaPropTable, t11FcSpSaTSelPropTable, and t11FcSpSaTransTable, specifying the proposals for an FC-SP entity acting as an SA_Initiator to present to the SA_Responder during the negotiation of Security Associations. The same information is also used by an FC-SP entity acting as an SA_Responder to decide what to accept during the negotiation of Security Associations. One of these tables, t11FcSpSaTransTable, is used not only for information about security transforms to propose and to accept, but also as agreed upon during the negotiation of Security Associations; - a table, t11FcSpSaTSelDrByTable, of Traffic Selectors having the security action of 'drop' or 'bypass' to be applied either to ingress traffic that is unprotected by FC-SP, or to all egress traffic; - four tables, t11FcSpSaPairTable, t11FcSpSaTSelNegInTable, t11FcSpSaTSelNegOutTable, and t11FcSpSaTSelSpiTable, containing information about active bidirectional pairs of Security Associations; in particular, t11FcSpSaPairTable has one row per active bidirectional SA pair, t11FcSpSaTSelNegInTable and t11FcSpSaTSelNegOutTable contain information on the Traffic Selectors negotiated on the SAs, and the t11FcSpSaTSelSpiTable is an alternate lookup table such that the Traffic Selector(s) in use on a particular Security Association can be quickly determined based on the (ingress) SPI value; - a table, t11FcSpSaControlTable, of control and other information concerning the generation of notifications for events related to FC-SP Security Associations; - one notification, t11FcSpSaNotifyAuthFailure, generated on the occurrence of an Authentication failure for a received FC-2 or CT_IU frame.

One such list is configured to be proposed or accepted for use on a Fabric, by having the list's value of t11FcSpSaTransListIndex be the value of an instance of t11FcSpSaPropTransListIndex for that Fabric. Further, the proposing and accepting of security transforms is only done as a part of a proposal specified by a row of the t11FcSpSaPropTable, i.e., in combination with the proposing and accepting of Traffic Selectors as specified by the combination of t11FcSpSaPropTSelListIndex and t11FcSpSaPropTransListIndex in one row of the t11FcSpSaPropTable. The security (encryption and integrity) transform in use on an SA pair is indicated by having the pair's values of t11FcSpSaPairTransListIndex and t11FcSpSaPairTransIndex contain the values of t11FcSpSaTransListIndex and t11FcSpSaTransIndex for the transform's row in this table.

Subsequent occurrences of an Authentication Failure on the same Fabric within the same time window are counted but suppressed. The value of t11FcSpSaControlElapsed contains (a lower bound on) the elapsed time since the last generation of this notification for the same Fabric. The value of t11FcSpSaControlSuppressed contains the number of generations which were suppressed in the time window after that last generation, or zero if unknown."
