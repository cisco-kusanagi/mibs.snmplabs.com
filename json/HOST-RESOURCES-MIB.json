The revisions made were: New RFC document standards: Added Copyright notice, updated introduction to SNMP Framework, updated references section, added reference to RFC 2119, and added a meaningful Security Considerations section. New IANA considerations section for registration of new types Conversion to new SMIv2 syntax for the following types and macros: Counter32, Integer32, Gauge32, MODULE-IDENTITY, OBJECT-TYPE, TEXTUAL-CONVENTION, OBJECT-IDENTITY, MODULE-COMPLIANCE, OBJECT-GROUP Used new Textual Conventions: TruthValue, DateAndTime, AutonomousType, InterfaceIndexOrZero Fixed typo in hrPrinterStatus. Added missing error bits to hrPrinterDetectedErrorState and clarified confusion resulting from suggested mappings to hrPrinterStatus. Clarified that size of objects of type InternationalDisplayString is number of octets, not number of encoded symbols. Clarified the use of the following objects based on implementation experience: hrSystemInitialLoadDevice, hrSystemInitialLoadParameters, hrMemorySize, hrStorageSize, hrStorageAllocationFailures, hrDeviceErrors, hrProcessorLoad, hrNetworkIfIndex, hrDiskStorageCapacity, hrSWRunStatus, hrSWRunPerfCPU, and hrSWInstalledDate. Clarified implementation technique for hrSWInstalledTable. Used new AUGMENTS clause for hrSWRunPerfTable. Added Internationalization Considerations section. This revision published as RFC2790."

Although this MIB does not necessarily apply to devices whose primary function is communications services (e.g., terminal servers, routers, bridges, monitoring equipment), such relevance is not explicitly precluded.

In addition, all versions of a product should be registered under a subtree distinct to that product. With this strategy, a management station may uniquely determine the manufacturer and/or model of a product whose productID is unknown to the management station. Objects of this type may be useful for inventory purposes or for automatically detecting incompatibilities or version mismatches between various hardware and software components on a system. For example, the product ID for the ACME 4860 66MHz clock doubled processor might be: enterprises.acme.acmeProcessors.a4860DX2.MHz66 A software product might be registered as: enterprises.acme.acmeOperatingSystems.acmeDOS.six(6).one(1) "

These entries are associated with logical storage areas, as might be seen by an application, rather than physical storage entities which are typically seen by an operating system. Storage such as tapes and floppies without file systems on them are typically not allocated in chunks by the operating system to requesting applications, and therefore shouldn't appear in this table. Examples of valid storage for this table include disk partitions, file systems, ram (for some architectures this is further segmented into regular memory, extended memory, and so on), backing store for virtual memory (`swap space'). This table is intended to be a useful diagnostic for `out of memory' and `out of buffers' types of failures.
