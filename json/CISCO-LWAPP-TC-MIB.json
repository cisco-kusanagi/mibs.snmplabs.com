    "description": "This module defines textual conventions used throughout the Cisco enterprise MIBs designed for implementation on Central Controllers that terminate the Light Weight Access Point Protocol from LWAPP Access Points. The relationship between CC and the LWAPP APs can be depicted as follows: +......+ +......+ +......+ +......+ + + + + + + + + + CC + + CC + + CC + + CC + + + + + + + + + +......+ +......+ +......+ +......+ .. . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . +......+ +......+ +......+ +......+ +......+ + + + + + + + + + + + AP + + AP + + AP + + AP + + AP + + + + + + + + + + + +......+ +......+ +......+ +......+ +......+ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . +......+ +......+ +......+ +......+ +......+ + + + + + + + + + + + MN + + MN + + MN + + MN + + MN + + + + + + + + + + + +......+ +......+ +......+ +......+ +......+ The LWAPP tunnel exists between the controller and the APs. The MNs communicate with the APs through the protocol defined by the 802.11 standard. LWAPP APs, upon bootup, discover and join one of the controllers and the controller pushes the configuration, that includes the WLAN parameters, to the LWAPP APs. The APs then encapsulate all the 802.11 frames from wireless clients inside LWAPP frames and forward the LWAPP frames to the controller. GLOSSARY Access Point ( AP ) An entity that contains an 802.11 medium access control ( MAC ) and physical layer ( PHY ) interface and provides access to the distribution services via the wireless medium for associated clients. LWAPP APs encapsulate all the 802.11 frames in LWAPP frames and sends it to the controller to which it is logically connected. Advanced Encryption Standard ( AES ) In cryptography, the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), also known as Rijndael, is a block cipher adopted as an encryption standard by the US government. It is expected to be used worldwide and analysed extensively, as was the case with its predecessor, the Data Encryption Standard (DES). AES was adopted by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as US FIPS PUB 197 in November 2001 after a 5-year standardisation process. Central Controller ( CC ) The central entity that terminates the LWAPP protocol tunnel from the LWAPP APs. Throughout this MIB, this entity is also referred to as 'controller'. Light Weight Access Point Protocol ( LWAPP ) This is a generic protocol that defines the communication between the Access Points and the Central Controller. Management Frame Protection ( MFP ) A proprietary mechanism devised to integrity protect the otherwise unprotected management frames of the 802.11 protocol specification. Message Integrity Check ( MIC ) A checksum computed on a sequence of bytes and made known to the receiving party in a data communication, to let the receiving party make sure the bytes received were not compromised enroute. Mobile Node ( MN ) A roaming 802.11 wireless device in a wireless network associated with an access point. Temporal Key Integrity Protocol ( TKIP ) A security protocol defined to enhance the limitations of WEP. Message Integrity Check and per-packet keying on all WEP-encrypted frames are two significant enhancements provided by TKIP to WEP. Wired Equivalent Privacy ( WEP ) A security method defined by 802.11. WEP uses a symmetric key stream cipher called RC4 to encrypt the data packets. 802.11n 802.11n builds upon previous 802.11 standards by adding MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output). MIMO uses multiple transmitter and receiver antennas to allow for increased data throughput through spatial multiplexing and increased range. Control/Extension Channel A single 802.11 channel is 20 MHz wide. 802.11n allows the use of channels of width 40 MHz by combining two 20 MHz channels. The channels are known as the primary or control channel and secondary or extension channel. Both the channels are used for transmission and reception of data.
