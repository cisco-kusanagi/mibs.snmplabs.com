    "description": "This MIB module defines dot3MauType OBJECT-IDENTITIES and IANAifMauListBits, IANAifMauMediaAvailable, IANAifMauAutoNegCapBits, and IANAifJackType TEXTUAL-CONVENTIONs, specifying enumerated values of the ifMauTypeListBits, ifMauMediaAvailable / rpMauMediaAvailable, ifMauAutoNegCapabilityBits / ifMauAutoNegCapAdvertisedBits / ifMauAutoNegCapReceivedBits and ifJackType / rpJackType objects respectively, defined in the MAU-MIB. It is intended that each new MAU type, Media Availability state, Auto Negotiation capability and/or Jack type defined by the IEEE 802.3 working group and approved for publication in a revision of IEEE Std 802.3 will be added to this MIB module, provided that it is suitable for being managed by the base objects in the MAU-MIB. An Expert Review, as defined in RFC 2434 [RFC2434], is REQUIRED for such additions. The following reference is used throughout this MIB module: [IEEE802.3] refers to: IEEE Std 802.3, 2005 Edition: 'IEEE Standard for Information technology - Telecommunications and information exchange between systems - Local and metropolitan area networks - Specific requirements - Part 3: Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) access method and physical layer specifications'. This reference should be updated as appropriate when new MAU types, Media Availability states, Auto Negotiation capabilities, and/or Jack types are added to this MIB module.

    "description": "This data type is used as the syntax of the ifMauMediaAvailable and rpMauMediaAvailable objects in the (updated) definition of MAU-MIB's ifMauTable and rpMauTable respectively. Possible values are: other(1) - undefined (not listed below) unknown(2) - MAU's true state is unknown; e.g., during initialization available(3) - link, light, or loopback is normal notAvailable(4) - link loss, low light, or no loopback remoteFault(5) - a fault has been detected at the remote end of the link. This value applies to 10BASE-FB, 100BASE-T4 Far End Fault Indication and non-specified remote faults from a system running auto-negotiation invalidSignal(6) - invalid signal has been received from the other end of the link, 10BASE-FB only remoteJabber(7) - remote fault, due to jabber remoteLinkLoss(8) - remote fault, due to link loss remoteTest(9) - remote fault, due to test offline(10) - offline, Clause 37 Auto-Negotiation only autoNegError(11) - Auto-Negotiation Error, Clause 37 Auto-Negotiation only pmdLinkFault(12) - PMA/PMD receive link fault. In case of PAF (2BASE-TL / 10PASS-TS PHYs), all PMEs in the aggregation group have detected a link fault wisFrameLoss(13) - WIS loss of frame, 10GBASE-W only wisSignalLoss(14) - WIS loss of signal, 10GBASE-W only pcsLinkFault(15) - PCS receive link fault excessiveBER(16) - PCS Bit Error Ratio monitor reporting excessive error ratio dxsLinkFault(17) - DTE XGXS receive link fault, XAUI only pxsLinkFault(18) - PHY XGXS receive link fault, XAUI only availableReduced(19) - link normal, reduced bandwidth, 2BASE-TL / 10PASS-TS only ready(20) - at least one PME in the aggregation group is detecting handshake tones, 2BASE-TL / 10PASS-TS only If the MAU is a 10M b/s link or fiber type (FOIRL, 10BASE-T, 10BASE-F), then this is equivalent to the link test fail state/low light function. For an AUI, 10BASE2, 10BASE5, or 10BROAD36 MAU, this indicates whether loopback is detected on the DI circuit. The value of this attribute persists between packets for MAU types AUI, 10BASE5, 10BASE2, 10BROAD36, and 10BASEFP. At power-up or following a reset, the Media Available state will be unknown(2) for AUI, 10BASE5, 10BASE2, 10BROAD36, and 10BASE-FP MAUs. For these MAUs loopback will be tested on each transmission during which no collision is detected. If DI is receiving input when DO returns to IDL after a transmission and there has been no collision during the transmission, then loopback will be detected. The Media Available state will only change during noncollided transmissions for AUI, 10BASE2, 10BASE5, 10BROAD36, and 10BASE-FP MAUs. For 100BASE-T2, 100BASE-T4, 100BASE-TX, 100BASE-FX, 100BASE-LX10, and 100BASE-BX10 PHYs the enumerations match the states within the link integrity state diagram. Any MAU that implements management of [IEEE802.3] Clause 28 Auto-Negotiation, will map remote fault indication to remoteFault(5). Any MAU that implements management of Clause 37 Auto-Negotiation, will map the received RF1 and RF2 bits as follows: Offline maps to offline(10), Link_Failure maps to remoteFault(5), and Auto-Negotiation Error maps to autoNegError(11). The value remoteFault(5) applies to 10BASE-FB remote fault indication, the 100BASE-X far-end fault indication, and nonspecified remote faults from a system running Clause 28 Auto-Negotiation. The value remoteJabber(7), remoteLink loss(8), or remoteTest(9) SHOULD be used instead of remoteFault(5) where the reason for remote fault is identified in the remote signaling protocol. Where a Clause 22 MII or Clause 35 GMII is present, a logic one in the remote fault bit maps to the value remoteFault(5), a logic zero in the link status bit maps to the enumeration notAvailable(4). The value notAvailable(4) takes precedence over remoteFault(5). For 2BASE-TL and 10PASS-TS PHYs, the value unknown(2) maps to the condition where the PHY (PCS with connected PMEs) is initializing, the value ready(20) maps to the condition where the interface is down and at least one PME in the aggregation group is ready for handshake, the value available(3) maps to the condition where all the PMEs in the aggregation group are up, the value notAvailable(4) maps to the condition where all the PMEs in the aggregation group are down and no handshake tones are detected, the value availableReduced(19) maps to the condition where the interface is up, a link fault is detected at the receive direction by one or more PMEs in the aggregation group, but at least one PME is up and the enumeration pmdLinkFault(12) maps to the condition where a link fault is detected at the receive direction by all of the PMEs in the aggregation group. For 10 Gb/s the enumerations map to value of the link_fault variable within the Link Fault Signaling state diagram as follows: the value OK maps to the value available(3), the value Local Fault maps to the value notAvailable(4), and the value Remote Fault maps to the value remoteFault(5). The value pmdLinkFault(12), wisFrameLoss(13), wisSignalLoss(14), pcsLinkFault(15), excessiveBER(16), or dxsLinkFault(17) SHOULD be used instead of the value notAvailable(4), where the reason for the Local Fault state can be identified through the use of the Clause 45 MDIO Interface. Where multiple reasons for the Local Fault state can be identified, only the highest precedence error SHOULD be reported. This precedence in descending order is as follows: pxsLinkFault pmdLinkFault wisFrameLoss wisSignalLoss pcsLinkFault excessiveBER dxsLinkFault. Where a Clause 45 MDIO interface is present a logic zero in the PMA/PMD Receive link status bit ([IEEE802.3] Section 45.2.1.2.2) maps to the value pmdLinkFault(12), logic one in the LOF status bit (Section 45.2.2.10.4) maps to the value wisFrameLoss(13), a logic one in the LOS status bit (Section 45.2.2.10.5) maps to the value wisSignalLoss, a logic zero in the PCS Receive link status bit (Section 45.2.3.2.2) maps to the value pcsLinkFault(15), a logic one in the 10GBASE-R PCS Latched high BER status bit (Section 45.2.3.12.2) maps to the value excessiveBER, a logic zero in the DTE XS receive link status bit (Section 45.2.5.2.2) maps to the value dxsLinkFault(17) and a logic zero in the PHY XS transmit link status bit (Section 45.2.4.2.2) maps to the value pxsLinkFault(18).
