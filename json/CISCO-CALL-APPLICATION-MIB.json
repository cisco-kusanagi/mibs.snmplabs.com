        "description": "The changes to this MIB now provide call application statistics for monitoring the call applications. These call application stats are divided into 3 levels - per gateway level (Global). - per application-type level. - per application-instance level. | Level/State | Active | History | -------------+------------------+---------------- | Global lvl| Gauges | Counters | -------------+------------------+---------------- | App-Type lvl| Gauges records | Counter records | -------------+------------------+---------------- | App-Inst lvl| Not available | Counter records v -------------+------------------+---------------- An applicaiton gateway can have multiple types of call applications aka application scripts. User calls could be handled by any of this application types (scripts). Each user call can trigger an instance of this application type. An Application instance has a set of countres during its active and non-active (history) phase. These are available at App-Inst level records. App-Type level records have aggregated counters/gauges from all the application instances of its application type. Global level has aggregated counters/gauges from all application-type records. Gateway administrators are encouraged to follow a 'top-down' approach for monitoring and troubleshooting. This top-down approach emphasizes on polling 'Global active level gauges' for monitoring load on the gateway and 'Global history level counters' monitoring errors. To find out more details about a particular gauge or counter one can step down a level to App-Type level. Similarly, to find out further details, one can goto a level lower at 'Application-Instnace' for find out more details. Finally, event-logs are available at the lowest level for applicaiton instances. Following changes are as per the above mentioned scheme. - ccapAppGlobalAct group of objects are added to provide 'Active Global lvl' gauges. - ccapAppGlobalHis group of objects are added to provide 'Active Global lvl' gauges. - ccapApplicationTable is extended to provide 'Active App-Type lvl' gauges. - ccapAppTypeHistoryTable is added to provided 'History App-Type lvl' counters. - ccapAppInstanceHistoryTable is added to provide 'History App-Inst lvl' counters. This MIB also provides call application interface stats. The call application interfaces are the servers with which applications do the transactions for various services like HTTP, RTSP, TFTP, SMTP, AAA, ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition), TTS (Text-To-Speech), flash file read, RAM media recordings. Following are the new objects/tables to provide 'Application-Interface' statistics. - ccapAppIntfGlobal group of objects - ccapAppIntfHTTPTable - ccapAppIntfRTSPTable - ccapAppIntfTFTPTable - ccapAppIntfSMTPTable - ccapAppIntfAAAMethodListTable - ccapAppIntfASRTable - ccapAppIntfTTSTable - ccapAppIntfFlash group of objects - ccapAppIntfRAMRecord group of objects This MIB also provides facility to enable and disable statistics monitoring for call application at global level. Applicaion interface statistics can also be enabled/disabled through this MIB. Statistics can also be cleared at Global and App-type levels. Hence, lot of objects which could be reset/cleared are defined as ZeroBasedCounter32 TC based of Gauge32. Clearing operation is done either through MIB objects or through CLI (Command Line Interface). Clear or resetting operation in applied to a group of countres. For each group there is a 'discontinuity' object or 'lastResetTime' object provided which specifies the time when associated group of objects were cleared. Application infrastructure has facility to capture events from active application instances and save them in event log buffer in memory and later to FTP dump file. This is referred as event logging mechanism. Event logging can be enabled and disabled either from IOS CLI's or from SNMP objects provided in this MIB change set. This event log facility is available at 'Active and History App-Inst lvl'. Event logging is also available at 'App-Interface lvl', for per interface-type and per server of each interface type. This MIB provides facility to enable/disable application event log facility for all active application instances. However, the MIB does not provide objects to get the event logs, since they can be bulky and degrade the performance of the system. There are mechanisms to dump the event logs to either stdout or ftp through IOS CLI configurations."
