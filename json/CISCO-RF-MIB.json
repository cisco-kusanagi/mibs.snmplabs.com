    "description": "This MIB provides configuration control and status for the Redundancy Framework (RF) subsystem. RF provides a mechanism for logical redundancy of software functionality and is designed to support 1:1 redundancy on processor cards. RF is not intended to solve all redundancy schemes. Nor is RF designed to support redundant hardware, such as power supplies. Redundancy is concerned with the duplication of data elements and software functions to provide an alternative in case of failure. It is a key component to meeting 99.999% availability requirements for Class 5 carrier solutions. In the scope of this MIB definition, peer software elements are redundant and redundant software elements are peers."
