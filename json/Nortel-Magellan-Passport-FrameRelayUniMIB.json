The chosen default class of routing applies to all outgoing calls established using this DNA, and applies to the packets travelling in both directions on all outgoing calls (local to remote, and remote to local). For incoming calls, the default class of routing is chosen by the calling party (as opposed to DPN, where either end of the call can choose the default routing class). This attribute, if set to a value of normal, indicates that the default class of routing is normal reliability routing. If set to a value of high, then the default class of routing is high reliability routing. High reliability is the standard choice for most DPN and Passport services. It usually indicates that packets are overflowed or retransmitted at various routing levels. Typically high reliability results in duplication and disordering of packets in the network when errors are detected or during link congestion. However, the VC handles the duplication and disordering to ensure that packets are delivered to the DTE properly. For the Frame Relay service, duplication of packets is not desired, in which case, normal reliability may be chosen as the preferred class of routing."

If set to no, then this CUG is not the SIMPLE CUG, but an instance of the SELECTABLE CUG. The attribute 'preferential' is set to no by CAS when a CUG instance is created. If only one CUG instance exists under a DNA, and if this CUG's attributes 'incCalls' and 'outCall' are both set to allowed, then this CUG instance can be changed to a SIMPLE CUG by setting the attribute 'preferential' to yes.

    "description": "This group defines Frame Relay attributes collected by Frame Relay Vc. The purpose of Vc attributes is to aid end users and verification people to understand the Vc internal behavior. This is particularly useful when the network has experienced abnormality and we want to isolate problems and pinpoint trouble spots. Attributes are collected on a per Vc basis. Until a need is identified, statistics are not collected at a processor level. Each attribute is stored in a 32 bit field and is initialized to zero when a Vc enters into the data transfer state. When a PVC is disconnected and then connected again, the attributes will be reset. Attributes cannot be reset through other methods. Frame Relay Vc uses a best effort data packet delivery protocol and a different packet segmentation and combination methods from the General Vc. The Frame Relay Vc uses the same call setup and control mechanism (e.g. the support of non-flow control data packets) as in a General Vc. Most General Vc statistics and internal variables are used in a Frame Relay Vc and are displayed by software developers"

Rate adaptation is a feature that, in periods of congestion, adapts the rate at which the user is allowed to send data into the network to that which the network is able to handle at that time. This pro-active measure of handling congestion optimizes network resources by causing the ingress to discard frames that would otherwise be discarded in the network. If this attribute is set to on, then, at the onset of congestion, the excess information rate (EIR) is reduced to a very low rate. If congestion persists, then the allowed CIR is reduced geometrically by 25% of the current value at that time. The minimum to which CIR can be reduced is 1/16th (6.25%) of the provisioned value. As congestion alleviates, CIR is increased linearly by 6.25% of the provisioned value specified in committedInformationRate. If set to eirOnly, then rate adaptation will only apply to the excess information rate (EIR). At the onset of congestion, the allowed EIR is reduced by 25% of its provisioned value. If congestion persists, EIR is reduced geometrically by 25% of the current value at that time. As congestion alleviates, EIR is gradually increased linearly by 6.25% of the provisioned EIR. If set to cirProportionate, then rate adaptation will also only apply to the excess information rate (EIR). At the onset of congestion the initial allowed EIR is set to a multiple of the provisioned CIR. If congestion persists, the allowed EIR is reduced geometrically by 25% of the current value at that time. As congestion alleviates, EIR is gradually increased linearly by 6.25% of the provisioned EIR. Note that the allowed EIR may be set higher than the provisioned EIR, since it is calculated initially using another parameter, the provisioned CIR. If the allowed EIR at the moment is higher than the provisioned EIR, then the provisioned EIR is used instead. This attribute can only be set to on eirOnly or cirProportionate if rateEnforcement is turned on."

A higher setting therefore tends to favour the protection of the network over the allowed throughput of the user. A lower number indicates a lower sensitivity and therefore a slower reaction to network conditions. A slower reaction time results in a greater amount of user traffic allowed into the network, but can lead to a waste of network bandwidth since the traffic may be discarded at the congested resource.

    "description": "This attribute specifies whether internal Backward Congestion Indication (BCI) bits will report congestion external to the Passport network, as communicated through incoming BECN bits. If updateBCI is set to on, then BCI bits for incoming frames will be set if the BECN on the frame is set. If updatBCI is set to off, then incoming BECN bits will have no effect. Setting updateBCI on for a DLCI means that the remote end of the DLCI, which is specified by the remotedna and remotedlci attributes of the dc component of the dlci, may perform Rate Adaptation using the flow of incoming BECN bits, in addition to internal Passport congestion management systems. If the rateAdaptation attribute of the remote dlci is provisioned as eirOnly, cirProportionate, or on, then congestion from another network connected to a Passport network may trigger dynamic congestion management. If the rateAdaptation attribute of the remote dlci is provisioned to off, then the setting of updateBCI attribute here will have no effect.."

Rate adaptation is a feature that, in periods of congestion, adapts the rate at which the user is allowed to send data into the network to that which the network is able to handle at that time. This pro-active measure of handling congestion optimizes network resources by causing the ingress to discard frames that would otherwise be discarded in the network. If this attribute is set to on, then, at the onset of congestion, the excess information rate (EIR) is reduced to a very low rate. If congestion persists, then the allowed CIR is reduced geometrically by 25% of the current value at that time. The minimum to which CIR can be reduced is 1/16th (6.25%) of the provisioned value. As congestion alleviates, CIR is increased linearly by 6.25% of the provisioned value specified in committedInformationRate. If set to eirOnly, then rate adaptation will only apply to the excess information rate (EIR). At the onset of congestion, the allowed EIR is reduced by 25% of its provisioned value. If congestion persists, EIR is reduced geometrically by 25% of the current value at that time. As congestion alleviates, EIR is gradually increased linearly by 6.25% of the provisioned EIR. If set to cirProportionate, then rate adaptation will also only apply to the excess information rate (EIR). At the onset of congestion the initial allowed EIR is set to a multiple of the provisioned CIR. If congestion persists, the allowed EIR is reduced geometrically by 25% of the current value at that time. As congestion alleviates, EIR is gradually increased linearly by 6.25% of the provisioned EIR. Note that the allowed EIR may be set higher than the provisioned EIR, since it is calculated initially using another parameter, the provisioned CIR. If the allowed EIR at the moment is higher than the provisioned EIR, then the provisioned EIR is used instead. This attribute can only be turned on or eirOnly if rateEnforcement is turned on."

If there is no Frame Transfer Priority IE in the setup message, the first data byte of the X.213 Priority IE is used to select the transfer and discard priority values for the connection and the X.213 Priority IE is signaled to the called end in the setup message. If the Frame Transfer Priority IE is present in the Q.933 setup message, its value is used to select the transfer priority, the discard priority is taken from the FRUNI Dna component, and the X.213 Priority IE is ignored. Refer to the related Application Note for further details before setting the attribute value to proprietary."

    "description": "This attribute specifies the sensitivity of the rate adaptation system for Svc's on this interface. Since this attribute is in the Sig Component of an FR Uni component, all SVC DLCI's created for this FR Uni Service will take the raSensitivity attribute provisioned here. A higher number indicates a higher sensitivity and therefore a quicker reaction time to network conditions. A quicker reaction time allows the network to discard frames at the access and protect network resources, but can lead to false alarms and a greater fluctuation of the allowed rate. A higher setting therefore tends to favour the protection of the network over the allowed throughput of the user. A lower number indicates a lower sensitivity and therefore a slower reaction to network conditions. A slower reaction time results in a greater amount of user traffic allowed into the network, but can lead to a waste of network bandwidth since the traffic may be discarded at the congested resource. A lower setting therefore tends to favour the allowed throughput of the user over the protection of the network. This attribute is applicable for adapting EIR when rateAdaptation is eirOnly or cirProportionate, or CIR when rateAdaptation is on. This attribute is ignored if rateAdaptation is turned off."
