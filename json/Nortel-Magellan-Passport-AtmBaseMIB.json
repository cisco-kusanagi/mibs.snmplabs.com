It applies only to transmit traffic served on the common queues and does not apply to perVc queues. When port aggregation is on, the enqueue decision of cells or frames to a common queue is based upon the congestion state of the entire port to which the queue belongs. A port is defined to be as congested as the most congested queue amongst all its queues: the low, medium and high emission priority queues. Thus, for example, if the low priority queue is congested, the high priority queue will also experience discards even though the high priority queue may itself not be congested. Setting port aggregation on assures that the low priority queues are also serviced in the event of congestion. When the value of this attribute is set to off, the enqueue decision of cells or frames to a common queue is based solely upon the congestion state of that queue, not the port.

This attribute specifies the maximum number of resource records for the connections which utilize Logical Network Number (LNN) on the LogicalProcessor. A logical network is a subset of passport modules together with a subset of trunks that interconnect those modules. It carries the traffic for a defined set of network protocols. A LNN is used to identify a logical network. The connectionless services which utilize the logical networks require some processing at the intermediate nodes. This pool is allocated at the intermediate nodes to sustain these connectionless services. Due to limited resources, not all of the provisioned number of LNN connection resource records may be allocated. The actual number of resource records allocated is indicated by the sum of Aru lnnConnectionPoolAvailable and Aru lnnConnectionPoolUsage attributes. If the McsMgr DprsMcsEpG/x Ep/y EpD transportConnectionPreference attribute is set to atmOnly, each instance of the McsMgr DprsMcsEpG/x Ep/y component uses one resource record from this pool."

The congestion state of receive cell memory is indicated by a numeric value ranging from 3 to 0. When receive cell memory is in congestion state 'x', traffic with DP > 'x' is discarded before processing.

If the LogicalProcessor is associated with a card of one of the following cardTypes: 3pE3Atm, 3pDS3Atm, 3pOC3MmAtm, 3pOC3SmAtm, 3pE1Atm, 3pDS1Atm, 2pJ6MAtm; the number of available connections are distributed equally across the ports on the FP. The number of connections associated to a particular port limits the size of the Vcc space which can be defined by the ConnMap of the AtmIf linked to the port. If the ConnMap component does not exist, its default settings are used for this check. Furthermore, the value of this attribute is restricted based on the number of ports on the card. For one port cards, the minimum is 512, the maximum is 4096 and the value must be divisible by 256. For two port cards, the minimum is 1024, the maximum is 8192 and the value must be divisible by 512. For three port cards, the minimum is 1536, the maximum is 7680 and the value must be divisible by 768. If the LogicalProcessor is associated with a card of one of the following cardTypes: 8pE1Atm, 8pDS1Atm, the maximum value for this attribute is 10752. For SGAF cards, the Connmap attributes are set to their default values. Increasing the value of this attribute reduces the memory available for cell and frame memory. This attribute must be set to 0 if the connectionPoolCapacity attribute of the Arc Ov component is set to non-zero values."

When the value of this attribute is set to disabled, the CDV value can be determined by the following equation: CDV <= 2/ASR + 1/LS where ASR is the Actual Shaping Rate of the connection and LS is the Link Speed of the interface. When the value of this attribute is set to enabled, the CDV relationship changes to the following equation: CDV <= 1/ASR + 1/LS As can be noted from the equations above, setting this attribute to enabled can reduce the CDV significantly. CDV reduction may be used to conform to policers which have strict Cell Delay Variance Tolerance (CDVT). However using this function reduces the transmit bandwidth utilization of the following cards: 3pDS3Atm, 3pOC3Atm, 2pJ6MAtm. When the value is cardDependent, CDV reduction is disabled for cardtypes 3pDS3Atm, 3pOC3Atm, 2pJ6MAtm, 4pDS1Aal1, 4pE1Aal1 and enabled for all other cards."

When the value is aggregate, the enqueue decision of cells or frames to a common queue is based upon the congestion state of the entire port to which the queue belongs. A port is defined to be as congested as the most congested queue amongst all its common queues: the low, medium and high emission priority queues. Thus, for example, if the low priority queue is congested, the high priority queue also experiences discards even though the high priority queue may itself not be congested. Setting this attribute to aggregate assures that the low priority queues are also serviced in the event of congestion. When the value of this attribute is set to individualQueue, the enqueue decision of cells or frames to a common queue is based solely upon the congestion state of that queue, not the port. This setting assures that the absolute priority of the traffic is taken into account, regardless of whether the lower priority queues are being served."

This number limits the range of the ConnMap entries. If the Connmap component does not exist, its default settings are used for this check. Note that the value of this attribute must be evenly divisible by 256, and that port 2 supports at most 2560 connections, not the full 4096.

    "description": "This attribute indicates the maximum number of virtual links (VLs) that can exist on this AQM. Normally a virtual link contains all VCCs and VPCs provisioned for a port (OC-3, DS3, E3, etc), making a virtual link equivalent to a port. However, if an AtmIf linked to a port has provisioned virtual path terminations (VPTs) with a vptType of virtualLink, then there is one virtual link per VL VPT, and one virtual link for all remaining VCCs and VPCs not part of a VL VPT. Unless this attribute is overridden in the optional Override subcomponent, its value will be sameNumberAsPorts, indicating that there is one virtual link per port using the AQM. The value of maxVirtualLinks may restrict the maximum bandwidth allowed per virtual link. If the value of this attribute is sameNumberAsPorts there is no restriction on a virtual link's bandwidth; it may be any cell rate up to the port's link rate. If maxVirtualLinks is set to some other value, then all virtual links on the AQM are subject to a maximum cell rate, listed in the table below, which may be less than the port cell rate. maxVirtualLinks : cell rate 6: 163840 cell/s 14 : 81920 cell/s 29: 40960 cell/s On 2pOC3MmAtm2 and 2pOC3SmAtm2 cards, there is one AQM per port. Since one link is required for connections not part of a VL VPT, if maxVirtualLinks is 6 (for example), then up to fiveVL VPTs may be provisioned on the port. Continuing this example, each VPT's provisioned bandwidth can be no larger than 163840 cells/s (46% of the total OC-3 rate) and the total bandwidth available to independent VCCs and non VL VPTs will be no greater than 163840 cell/s. On 3pDS3Atm2 and 3pE3Atm2 cards, there is one AQM for the card. Since three links are required for connections not part of a VL VPT (one per port), if maxVirtualLinks is 6 (for example), then up to threeVL VPTs may be provisioned on the card. In this case, since the maximum cell rate per virtual link is 163840 cell/s, which is greater than the port cell rate for both DS3 and E3, there is no restriction on the bandwidth assigned to VL VPTs or available to independent VCC and non VL VPT connections.

Transmit cell memory is used for storing ATM cells to be transmitted by connections. It includes all cells in all connections at all service categories. The first value indicates the transmit cell memory size. It is the amount of transmit memory which is available for cell queueing, after the amount of memory specified by connectionPoolCapacity. The current value of txCellMemoryUsage together with the vector of values in txCellMemoryThresholds determines the txCellMemoryCongestionState. The congestion state determines whether cells of a given discard priority (DP) are discarded or queued for transmit. When the txCellMemoryUsage attribute is between threshold 0 and threshold 1, the txCellMemoryCongestionState indicates the value 0. In congestion state 0, traffic with DP > 0 is discarded. Threshold 1 is set approximately at 90 percent of threshold 0, the total transmit cell memory size. When the txCellMemoryUsage attribute is between threshold 1 and threshold 2, the txCellMemoryCongestionState indicates the value 1. In congestion state 1, traffic with DP > 1 is discarded. Threshold 2 is set approximately at 85 percent of threshold 0, the total transmit cell memory size. When the txCellMemoryUsage attribute is between threshold 2 and threshold 3, the txCellMemoryCongestionState indicates the value 2. In congestion state 2, traffic with DP > 2 is discarded. Threshold 3 is set approximately at 75 percent of threshold 0, the total transmit cell memory size. When the txCellMemoryUsage attribute is below threshold 3, the txCellMemoryCongestionState indicates the value 3. In congestion state 3, traffic with DP=3 is queued."

Another impact of setting this attribute to aggregate is that the per connection queue limits for nrtVBR and UBR connections will be increased to the link pool size and their discard thresholds will be modified to be aligned with the free list discard thresholds. When the value of this attribute is set to individualQueue, the enqueue decision of cells or frames to a queue is based solely upon the congestion state of that queue, not the port. This setting assures that the absolute priority of the traffic is taken into account, regardless of whether the lower priority queues are being served. On 3pOC3SmAtm2 and 3pOC3MmAtm2 cards, if more than one override component exists, they must have the same setting for this attribute. Otherwise, setting the attribute under one override component applies to the entire card."
