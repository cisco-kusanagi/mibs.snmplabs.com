    "description": "This MIB module provides network management information on IEEE 802.11 wireless device association management and data packet forwarding configuration and statistics. This MIB is an extension to the IEEE802dot11-MIB and provides per client based information. The IEEE802dot11-MIB is defined in the IEEE Std 802.11-Jan 14 1999, Wireless LAN Medium Access Control and Physical Layer Specifications, by the LAN MAN Standards Committee of the IEEE Computer Society. GLOSSARY and ACRONYMS Access point (AP) Transmitter/receiver (transceiver) device that commonly connects and transports data between a wireless network and a wired network. AES Advanced Encryption Standard Association The service used to establish access point or station mapping and enable STA invocation of the distribution system serivces. (Wireless clients attempt to connect to access points.) Bridge Device that connects two or more segments and reduces traffic by analyzing the destination address, filtering the frame, and forwarding the frame to all connected segments. Bridge AP It is an AP that functions as a transparent bridge between 2 wired LAN segments. Bridge Host This is also known as Work Group Bridge. This is a non-root bridge that is connected to a remote LAN segment and will only communicate with repeaters or root bridges. It does not accept association from other wireless devices. BSS IEEE 802.11 Basic Service Set (Radio Cell). The BSS of an AP comprises of the stations directly associated with the AP. CCX Cisco Compatible eXtensions A set of specifications which when implemented would make a client radio interoperable with a Cisco WLAN infrastructure and make best use of the innovations for enhanced security, mobility, quality of service and network management. CCMP Code Mode/CBC Mac Protocol Client (Client Station) A wireless device in a wireless network associated with an access point. Direct Sequence Spread Sprectrum ( DSSS ) DSSS is a method to send data where the transmitting and receiving systems operate at frequencies as wide as 22MHz. The wide channels help the participating systems to send more information at higher data rates than the FSSS systems. EAP Extensible Authentication Protocol EAP-TLS Extensible Authentication Protocol-Transport Layer Security Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum ( FSSS ) FSSS systems hop from one frequency to another in the allowed band of frequencies during the data transmission. 83 MHz is specified as the allowed band of frequencies in the 2.4 GHz spectrum. IEEE 802.11 Standard to encourage interoperability among wireless networking equipment. IEEE 802.11b The IEEE 802.11b standard describes DSSS systems that operate in the 2.4 GHz ISM band at data rates of 1, 2, 5,5 and 11 Mbps. IEEE 802.11a The IEEE 802.11a standard describes wireless LAN operation in the 5 GHz UNII band at data rates of 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 and 54 Mbps. IEEE 802.11g This standard specifies operation in 2.4 GHz ISM band at data rates of 6, 9, 12, 18. 24, 36, 48 and 54 Mbps. Industrial, Scientific and Medical band (ISM) A license-free band specified by the Federal Communications Commission for use by the wireless LAN systems. The ISM bands are located starting at 902 MHz, 2.4GHz and 5.8 GHz. MIC Message Integrity Check. A MIC can, optionally, be added to WEP-encrypted 802.11 frames. Non-Root Bridge This wireless bridge does not connect to the main wired LAN segment. It connects to a remote wired LAN segment and can associate to root bridges and other non-root bridges that accept client associations. It also can accept associations from other non-root bridges, repeater access points, and client devices. PCI Peripheral Component Interconnect A local bus standard developed by Intel Corporation. Most modern PCs include a PCI bus. PCI is a 64-bit bus, though it is usually implemented as a 32-bit bus. It can run at clock speeds of 33 or 66 MHz. At 32 bits and 33 MHz, it yields a throughput rate of 133 MBps. Repeater Device that connects multiple segments, listening to each and repeating signal on one to every other connected one; regenerates each transmission so that it can travel farther. Repeater or Non-root Access Point The repeater access point is not connected to the wired LAN. The Repeater is a wireless LAN transceiver that transfers data between a client and another access point, another repeater, or between two bridges. The repeater is placed within radio range of an access point connected to the wired LAN, another repeater, or an non-root bridge to extend the range of the infrastructure. Root Access Point This access point connects clients to the main wired LAN. Root Wireless Bridge This wireless bridge is connected to the main wired LAN. This wireless bridge can communicate with non-root wireless bridges, repeater access points, and client devices but not with another wireless root bridge. Only one wireless bridge in a wireless LAN can be set as the wireless root bridge. SSID Radio Service Set ID. It is used for identification during association. STA (WSTA) A non-AP 802.11 wireless station. TKIP WPA Temporal Key encryption. Unlicensed National Information Infrastucture (UNII) The UNII bands are in the 5 GHz range and are 100 MHz wide. These bands are used by 802.11a-compliant devices. WEP Wired Equivalent Privacy. 'WEP' is generally used to refer to 802.11 encryption. WPA WiFi Protected Access Work Group Bridges (WGB) See bridge host."
