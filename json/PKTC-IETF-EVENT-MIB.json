    "description": "This MIB object allows a management station to clear the local log of generated events, reset the management event descriptions, or both. MTAs generate management events. These events are stored in the MIB table pktcEventLogTable. If a management station needs to clear all the current entries (e.g., after a troubleshooting operation is complete), it can do so by setting the resetEventLogTable(0) bit to a value of '1'. The MTA is pre-configured with the events that it can generate. This is stored in the MIB table pktcEventTable. This table also contains the descriptions associated with these events. These descriptions can be modified by a management station. However, if the management station wishes to reset the descriptions to factory defaults, it can do so by setting the resetEventTable(1) bit to a value of '1'. The MTA actions are summarized below: Bit resetEventLogTable(0) set to a value of '1' - delete all entries in pktcEventLogTable; - reset the value of pktcEventLogIndex to '0'. Bit resetEventTable(1) set to a value of '1' - reset the pktcEventTable to the factory default values. Bits resetEventLogTable(0) and resetEventTable(1) set to a value of '1' - perform the above actions as though they were performed individually (in any order). Setting a reset bit to a value of '0' MUST NOT result in any action. The MTA MUST perform the above actions regardless of persistence (i.e., storage in non-volatile memory). The MTA MUST always return a value of '00' when this MIB object is read. A management station that resets tables using this MIB object needs to be careful about the impact to other management stations that may be reliant on the information contained in the table(s) being reset. For example, say management station A creates a specific set of event descriptions in the event table (pktcEventTable) for debugging purposes and expects any generated events to report the modified descriptions. In such a case, if another management station resets the event table to factory defaults, any subsequent events will not contain the modified descriptions expected by management station A. Such multi-manager contentions are not addressed within this MIB module. Thus, management stations are RECOMMENDED to use this MIB object with care and caution, and only when absolutely required."

If none of the bits are set, then no action is taken upon occurrence of the event. The success of transmission using syslog and SNMP depends on the MTA configuration. For example, a valid syslog server address is required for syslog message transmission. Specification of a management event does not necessarily include the actions to be taken upon its generation, i.e., it does not need to specify if a generated event needs to be transmitted via SNMP or syslog, or stored locally. Thus, certain default values are specified, based on the event's severity level specified by the MIB object pktcEventSeverityLevel, as follows: - If the severity level of an event is emerg(0), alert(1), crit(2), or err(3), set the bits for local(0), syslog(1), and snmpInform(3) to a value of '1' and set the remaining bits to a value of '0'. - For an event with any other severity level, set the bits for local(0) and syslog(1) to a value of '1' and set the rest of the bits to a value of '0'."
