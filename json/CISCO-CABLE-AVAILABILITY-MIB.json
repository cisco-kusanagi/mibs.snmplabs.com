    "description": "This is the MIB module for management of Hot Standby Connection to Connection Protocol (HCCP) features. HCCP is a Cisco proprietary solution for High System Availability for Cable Modem Termination Systems (CMTS). The HCCP protocol is primarily responsible for failure detection and to initiate switchover from one CMTS to another. The CMTS protection is at the RF mac domain level, where protecting and working CMTS cable interfaces operate on the same downstream and upstream frequency. HCCP Terminology: HCCP group: A set of RF MAC interfaces which communicate using HCCP messaging. HCCP member: Each RF MAC interface configured for HCCP. Protect: A member in a HCCP group which acts as the hot standby and protecting other members. Working: The member in a HCCP group that is being protected. Thus a 'HCCP group' consists of 'HCCP members' which are RF MAC interfaces configured to function as 'Protect' or 'Working'. Some RF mac interfaces are configured to form a 'HCCP group' and members within one 'HCCP group' communicate with each other using HCCP messaging. By HCCP messaging, some member acting as 'Protect' or hot standby can detect a failure on the other members which are designated as 'Working' in the same HCCP group. The 'Protect' can then take over traffic on the failed interface. Protection scenarios can be N+1 or 1+1. In the N+1 protection scenario, there is only one CMTS designated for protection of N CMTS. For example in 1+1 : When one linecard fails, the other automatically takes over its traffic. During normal operation, only one linecard forwards traffic, the other linecard stands by and listens to the messages passed from the active one. While in the standby mode, the linecard does not forward traffic. HCCP will automatically switchover to the standby in cases of software failures (crash), linecard insertion/removal, interface shutdowns and cable wiring failures etc. Both Protect and Working are preconfigured on the CMTS and all HCCP configuration must comply with the actual cable plant deployment for correct operation of the HCCP protocol. This MIB includes objects to support the HCCP feature on the CMTS."
