If this object has the value `stopAfterOne(1)', then a GetNext or GetBulk operation will provide one pass through a given table, i.e., the agent will continue to the next object or table, instead of incrementing a TimeMark INDEX value, even if there exists higher TimeMark values which are valid for the same conceptual row. This mode is not strictly compliant with the TimeFilter textual convention definition, because potentially many conceptual rows will be skipped instead of returned in a GetNext or GetBulk operation. Such rows are identical to each other, except for the returned TimeMark INDEX value. This mode is intended only for testing purposes, however it may also be useful if an NMS wishes to utilize the GetBulk PDU. This mode will prevent the GetBulk responses from containing duplicate rows due to the TimeFilter mechanism. If this object has the value `stopAfterAll(2)', then a getNext or getBulk MIB walk will repeat through the same MIB table until the TimeMark for the most-recently changed entry is reached. Note that as long as traffic occurs on the monitored interface, it is possible a highest value of the TimeFilter INDEX may never be reached. This mode is strictly compliant with the TimeFilter textual convention definition. Note that GetBulk PDU responses in this mode will likely contain multiple copies of the same MIB instances, differing only in the TimeMark INDEX value. As an example, consider row 'fooEntry' which was last updated at 'time 1000'. An NMS may use any TimeMark INDEX value in the range '0' to '1000', and the current (i.e., time of get request) counter values for the 'fooEntry' will be returned by agent. In the 'stopAfterOne' mode, the agent will not increment the fooEntry TimeMark index under any conditions. In the 'stopAfterAll' mode, the agent will increment any fooEntry TimeMark INDEX value in the range '0' to '999', up until the TimeMark value of '1000' is reached."

When creating an entry in this table using the 'createAndwait' method, the following rules are applied: - no SPAN consistency check is done for the entry until the entry is activated. An entry will not be activated if it fails the SPAN consistency check described for the 'createAndGo' method. -an instance remains in the 'notReady' state until the associated portCopyStatus changes to 'active'. When the agent processes a request of adding an entry using 'createAndGo' method or a request that sets the value of portCopyStatus object to 'active', the following rules are applied: The agent will add the entry to a SPAN session having the same portCopySessionNo, or create a new session if it does not exist. To join an existing session, either portCopySource or portCopyDest, but not both, must exist in one of the entries from the same SPAN session. In addition, the following actions will be taken after a successful join: 1. The portCopyDirection, portCopyLoVlanMask, and portCopyHiVlanMask values will overwrite the existing values associated with this port copy session. 2. The portCopyDestLoVlanMask, portCopyDestHiVlanMask, and portCopyOption values will overwrite the existing values associated the same portCopyDest and this port copy session. 3. If the value of portCopyDest object does not exist in the existing SPAN session, each of the ports identified in the portCopySource is added to this SPAN session. For example, given an existing SPAN session having ports 1, 2, and 3 as source ports, and port A as the destination port, if an entry is added by an NMS with indices of (2,B), the agent will also add entries for the other source ports (e.g. (1,B) and (3,B)) to the session. The same algorithm for adding entries will be applied if the portCopySource does not already belong to this SPAN session. When the agent processes a request to change the RowStatus of an entry from 'active' to 'notInService', the following rules are applied: - That entry will be removed from its participating SPAN session. The new RowStatus state will be 'notInService'. - all entries in the table that have the same value of portCopySessionNo and same value of portCopySource are also set to 'NotInService'. When agent processes a request to delete an entry, the following rules are applied: - the entry is simply removed if it is not currently active. - if the portCopySessionNo value is non-zero and the value of portCopyRemoveSrc object is set to 'true', then all entries with the same value of portCopySessionNo and same value of portCopySource are deleted. - if the portCopySessionNo value is non-zero and the value of portCopyRemoveSrc object is set to 'false', then all entries with the same value of portCopySessionNo and same value of portCopyDest are deleted. - if the last portCopy entry is removed from a session, then the session information is also removed."

If this object has a non-zero length, and at least one octet contains a non-zero value, or the portCopyDestLoVlanMask contains at least one non-zero octet, then traffic will be filtered, based on the indicated IEEE 802.1Q or ISL VLAN ID, before it is copied to the indicated destination port. Only frames (tagged or untagged) which match the indicated VLAN ID(s) will be copied to the indicated destination port. If a VLAN is included in the portCopyDestHiVlanMask object, it should also be included in the portCopyHiVlanMask object and vice versa. VLAN IDs are encoded as a string of octets containing one bit per VLAN to be included in the port copy operation. The first octet corresponds to VLANs with VlanIndex values of 2048 through 2055; the second octet to VLANs 2056 through 2063; etc. The most significant bit of each octet corresponds to the lowest value VlanIndex in that octet. If the bit corresponding to a VLAN is set to '1', then the traffic associated with that VLAN will be selected for the indicated port copy operation. Note that if the length of this string is less than 256 octets, any 'missing' octets are assumed to contain the value zero. An NMS may omit any zero-valued octets from the end of this string in order to reduce SetPDU size, and the agent may also omit zero-valued trailing octets, to reduce the size of GetResponse PDUs. The creation and deletion of instances of this object is controlled by the portCopyStatus object found in the augmented portCopyEntry. It is an implementation-specific matter as to how many VLANs may be selected from a particular physical source port at any one time, or whether this object may be modified while the associated portCopyStatus object is equal to 'active'."

If this object has the value 'false', then the probe will attempt to monitor all packets detected on the indicated interface, in the event any RMON collections are actually configured. The data returned in all RMON collection tables associated with this interface will represent non-sampled monitored counter values. If this object has the value 'true', then the probe will use adaptive statistical sampling techniques to monitor the indicated interface, in the event any RMON collections are actually configured. The data returned in RMON collection tables associated with this interface may be based on statistical approximations. In this mode, the RMON agent will also maintain additional MIB objects to provide the confidence interval information for each sampled counter. These objects can be found in the CISCO-RMON-SAMPLING-MIB. When this object transitions from 'false' to 'true', all active packet capture functions will be suspended, without affecting the contents of any associated filterEntry, filter2Entry, channelEntry, channel2Entry, bufferControlEntry, captureBufferEntry, or captureBufferHighCapacityEntry. Only the low-level packet capture processing is deactivated. When this object transitions from 'true' to 'false', all suspended packet capture functions associated with the interface will be reactivated. Note that an NMS application which is unaware of this MIB object will not be able to detect suspended packet capture operations or sampled collections, however multi-manager mis-configuration issues are beyond the scope of this MIB. The packet capture function Get and Set operations are not affected by this object. If an interface cannot be sampled, or the sampling configuration cannot be modified, then such an instance of this object will be implemented with read-only access."
