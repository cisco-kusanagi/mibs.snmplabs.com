    "description": "This MIB was designed to complement the CISCO-RF-MIB by providing additional optional status and configuration control for redundant CPU platforms. However, the MIB should also be applicable to redundant platforms which don't use the RF Redundancy Framework software since it makes no direct references to any CISCO-RF-MIB objects or textual conventions and no direct reference to any RF states, RF events or internal information. Glossary of terms used in this document: Active - A redundant CPU which is actively controlling the system. Running configuration - The runtime configuration of a system which reflects current configured hardware or software settings. Runtime configuration which is not stored in non-volatile memory may be lost if the system loses power. Standby - A redundant CPU which is not currently controlling the system, but which can take over control if the Active CPU fails. Startup configuration - A copy of system configuration stored in non-volatile memory which can be applied following a system powerup. For platforms where all runtime configuration is automatically stored in a non-volatile manner, the running and startup configurations are always identical. Switchover - The transfer of control from one CPU to a redundant CPU. Sync - The mirroring (or synchronizing) of system state, configuration, statistics or other information from the Active CPU to a Standby CPU to allow it to maintain full system control following a switchover."
