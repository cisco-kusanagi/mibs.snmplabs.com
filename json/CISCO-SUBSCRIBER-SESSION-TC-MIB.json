    "description": "An enumerated integer-value describing the type of subscriber session. This value has the intent of refining the interface type assigned to a subscriber session. The interface type assigned to a subscriber session groups those types of subscriber sessions with similar interface semantics. A PPP subscriber session consists of a PPP connection (RFC-1661) and has an interface type of 'ppp'. The following subscriber types refine PPP subscriber sessions: 'pppSubscriber' A PPP connection initiated over a circuit (e.g., an ISDN line or ATM VC) using the LCP (RFC-1661). 'pppoeSubscriber' A PPP connection over Ethernet (RFC-2516), initiated by a PADI (PPPoE Active Discovery Initiation) packet. 'l2tpSubscriber' A PPP connection over an L2TP tunnel (RFC-2661), initiated by an Incoming-Call-Request control message. 'l2fSubscriber' A PPP connection over an L2F tunnel (RFC-2341), initiated by a L2F_OPEN message with a non-zero MID. An IP subscriber session consists of the routed traffic associated with a subscriber IP address having an interface type of 'ipSubscriber'. Routed traffic describes IP traffic that transits at least one router. If a subscriber's IP address is not unique to the system, further distinguishing characteristics, such as VRF or MAC address, form part of the subscriber's identity. The following subscriber types refine IP subscriber sessions: 'ipInterfaceSubscriber' An IP subcriber session provisioned by the system's configuration which consists of all traffic received by the interface to which the provisioning applies. 'ipPktSubscriber' An IP subscriber session initiated by the receipt of the first packet received with an unclassified source IP address. 'ipDhcpv4Subscriber' An IP subscriber session initiated by the receipt of a DHCPv4 DISCOVER packet (RFC-2131). 'ipRadiusSubscriber' An IP subscriber session initiated by the receipt of a RADIUS Access-Request packet (RFC-2865). An L2 subscriber session consists of the non-routed traffic associated with a subscriber IP address having an interface type of 'l2Subscriber'. Non-routed traffic describes IP traffic that doesn't transit a router, meaning that the subscriber must be directly connected to the system or have a connection through an L2 access network (e.g., bridges, switches, and tunnels). The following subscriber types refine L2 subscriber sessions: 'l2MacPacketSubscriber' An L2 subscriber session initiated by the receipt of the first layer 2 packet with an unclassified source MAC address. 'l2Dhcpv4Subscriber' An L2 subscriber session initiated by the receipt of a DHCPv4 DISCOVER packet (RFC-2131). 'l2RadiusSucriber' An L2 subscriber session initiated by the receipt of a RADIUS Access-Request packet (RFC-2865). The system should assign the value 'other' to any subscriber session not recognized by the implementation of a MIB module using this textual convention. The value 'all' represents a special value used to indicate all subscriber session types. For example, a scope of aggregation that includes all subscriber session types uses this value to indicate this fact.",
