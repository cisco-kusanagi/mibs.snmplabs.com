    "description": "The MIB module to configure the Frame Relay connection configuration. Terminologies Used: SIW - Frame-Relay-to ATM Service Interworking. In SIW, the ATM port connected to a frame relay port does not need to be aware that it is connected to an interworking function. This is explained in document FRF.8. NIW - Frame-Relay-to ATM Network Interworking. In NIW, the ATM port connected to a frame relay port does need to be aware that it is connected to an interworking function. PVC - Permanent Virtual Circuit OR Permanent Virtual Connection A frame relay logical link, whose endpoints and class of service are defined by network management. A PVC consists of the originating frame relay network element address, originating DLCI, terminating frame relay network element address and terminating DLCI. This is controlled by PAR(Portable Auto Route) controller. SPVC - Soft Permanent Virtual Circuits. This is a PVC controlled by PNNI Controller. Frame Relay PVC/SPVC end-point/Channel is referred to as frame Relay connection in this MIB. Traffic shaping parameters: CIR, EIR, Bc, Be, DE, Tc, AR corresponding to rate of the physical interface. CIR - Committed Information Rate. This is the rate of traffic that the PVC will support as 'comitted' traffic. The committed rate(in bits per second) at which the ingress access interface trunk interfaces, and egress access interface of a frame relay network transfer information to the destination frame relay end system under normal conditions. The rate is averaged over a minimum time interval Tc. AR - Access Rate The maximum number of bits per second that an end station can transmit into the network is bounded by the acess rate of the user-network interface. The line speed of the user network connection limits the access rate. Bc - Committed Burst Size The maximum amount of data(in bits) that the network agrees to transfer, under normal conditions during a time interval Tc. The data is in bytes in the current implementation. Be - Excess Burst Size The maximum amount of uncommitted data(in bits) in excess of BC that a frame relay network can attempt to deliver during a time interval Tc. This data generally is delivered with a low probability than Bc. The network treats Be data as discard eligible. The data is in bytes in the current implementation. Tc - The committed rate measurement interval. The time interval during which the user can send only BC committed amount of data and BE excess amount of data. EIR - Excess Information Rate This is the bandwidth in excess of CIR the PVC will be allowed to burst on a a given PVC. The average rate at which excess traffic is to be policed. This number is computed based on Bc, Be, CIR and Tc. DE - Discard Eligibility Frame Forwarding Port: Frame Forwarding Ports are identified by portType = frame-forward(3). NOTE: The objects related to frame relay ports are available in ifTable,if ifTable is implemented in service module/card. Following Service Modules support ifTable: FRSM-12 "

This counter is used by the NMS to determine if a connection configuration had been modified and requires an upload. This functionality is conventionally achieved by time stamping using a time-of-day clock. However, in switches where time-of-day clock is not available, the following scheme is used: The upload counter is incremented, when: * assignment of connection to an end point channel. This happens when a connection is added and assigned this channel number. * de-assignment of connection from a channel number. This happens when a connection is deleted and the end point resource is released. * When there is a configuration change done to the connection that is associated with this end point channel number. In a new system, an unutilised resouce (channel number) has a counter value of zero. When a connection is added to this channel end point, the counter is incremented. And is incremented for any of the above operations. When a connection is deleted the value of this counter is incremented and preserved till a new connection gets associated with this channel end point.
