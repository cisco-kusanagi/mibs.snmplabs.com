The Command Generator (Network Management Application) reads this variable and uses the (non-zero-length string) value read when creating a new row with an SNMP SET. When the SET is performed, the Command Responder (agent) must determine whether the value is indeed still unused; Two Network Management Applications may attempt to create a row (configuration entry) simultaneously and use the same value. If it is currently unused, the SET succeeds and the Command Responder (agent) changes the value of this object, according to an implementation-specific algorithm. If the value is in use, however, the SET fails. The Network Management Application must then re-read this variable to obtain a new usable value. Note that the string containing the single octet with the value 0x00 is a reserved value used to represent the special case where no additional indexes can be provisioned, or in systems that do not offer write access, objects defined using this TEXTUAL-CONVENTION MUST return the string containing the single octet with the value 0x00."
