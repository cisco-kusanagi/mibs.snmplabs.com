    "description": "The MSCP maintains all provisionable data in non-volatile storage so that configuration settings are retained during system shutdowns and restarts. The configuration database is version controlled to facilitate the detection of an incompatible software load and/or database. The BTI 7000 Series supports user-initiated backup and restore operations of the configuration database through the SNMP Set requests performed on the dbBackupAndRestoreCmd object with a value corresponding to the required action. In a backup operation, the database is uploaded to a user-specified network location (that is, a local PC or a remote PC) using the file transfer protocol (FTP), or it is stored locally on the MSCP. In a restore operation, the database is restored using a version of the file from an FTP server or locally from the MSCP. The integrity of the file is validated to ensure that it matches the current software load on the BTI 7000 Series. The DbBackupAndRestoreCmd textual convention is the value of the dbBackupAndRestoreCmd object, which is used to activate a database backup operation, or the various steps of a database restore operation. These operations are initiated when a set request is performed on the dbBackupAndRestoreCmd object with a value corresponding to the desired action, as explained below. A get request on this type returns the value noOp. The valid values for DbBackupAndRestoreCmd that can be used in a set operation are: - 'invokeBackup': used to perform a database backup operation. The operation may be used to perform a local database backup, or to save the database backup to a remote repository. - 'loadRestore': used to initiate a database restore operation. The operation may be the restoration of a local database backup or of a remote database backup - 'invokeRestore': continues a database restore operation after the loadRestore stage has completed. The database being restored is made active on the SCP circuit pack at this stage. - 'applyRestore': Obsolete this functionality is now done as part of the invokeRestore. - 'commitRestore': is used to complete a database restore operation and can be used after the applyRestore action completes - 'cancelRestore': is used to cancel and back out of a database restore operation in progress and can be used before the commitRestore action is called. In order for the set request on the dbBackupAndRestoreCmd object to complete successfully, the values of other objects must be set in the same set request for some of the commands. The additional objects required to be set along with the dbBackupAndRestoreCmd object for each DbBackupAndRestoreCmd value are listed below. - invokeBackup: must also set dbBackupAndRestoreType. If this object is set to remote, then the dbBackupAndRestoreAddress, dbBackupAndRestoreFtpUser and dbBackupAndRestorePswd object values must also be specified in the set request. The dbBackupAndRestoreCheckAlm object may optionally be set when the invokeBackup action is performed. Also when the dbBackupAndRestoreType is set to remote the dbBackupAndRestorePath is optional. If not specified the default name is used. - loadRestore: must also set dbBackupAndRestoreType. If this object is set to remote, then the dbBackupAndRestoreAddress, dbBackupAndRestorePath, dbBackupAndRestoreFtpUser and dbBackupAndRestorePswd object values must also be specified in the set request. The dbBackupAndRestoreCheckSysName object may be set when the loadRestore action is performed, but is not mandatory. - invokeRestore: must also set dbBackupAndRestoreInvokeFilename to confirm the name of the backed file to be used in the restore operation. Optionally, the dbBackupAndRestoreCheckAlm object may be set. - applyRestore, commitRestore, cancelRestore: no additional object values are required to be included for these set requests"

However, during the life cycle of the BTI 7000 Series, it might be necessary to upgrade the system software. Normally, the system software is upgraded to: \ufffd Support the functionality of new circuit packs \ufffd Provide new features for existing circuit packs \ufffd Add specific software improvements Performing a system software upgrade on the BTI 7000 Series is non-service affecting. The upgrade process is designed for application environments that require that the optical signals passing through the BTI 7000 Series are not interrupted. The BTI 7000 Series supports a user-initiated software upgrade operation through the SNMP Set requests performed on the swUpgradeCmd object with a value corresponding to the required action. The SwUpgradeCmd textual convention is the value of the swUpgradeCmd object, which is used to activate the various steps of the software upgrade procedure on the system. These steps are initiated when a set request is performed on the swUpgradeCmd object with a value corresponding to the desired action, as explained below. A get request will return the value noOp. The valid values for SwUpgradeCmd that can be used in a set operation are: - 'checkUpgrade': used to perform a pre-upgrade check of the system to ensure that it is ready for the upgrade process, and that the load files on the server are accessible. - 'loadUpgrade': used to initiate a system upgrade by downloading the load files from a remote server to the SCP software load storage area. - 'invokeUpgrade': continues a system upgrade operation after the loadUpgrade stage has completed. First the upgrade load is installed on all circuit packs in the system, then each card is rebooted to run the upgrade load. - 'commitUpgrade': is used to complete a system upgrade operation and can be used after the invkUpgrade action completes - 'cancelUpgrade': is used to cancel and back out of a system software upgrade operation in progress and can be used before the cmmtUpgrade action is called. - 'invokeScpUpgrade': is a special-purpose upgrade step used in place of the invkUpgrade value when an upgrade is being performed on an SCP pack only. Such a targeted upgrade is valid only when an SCP pack is replaced and the new pack requires a software upgrade to make its software version consistent with the system In order for the set request on the swUpgradeCmd object to complete successfully, the values of other objects must be set in the same set request for some of the commands. The additional objects required to be set along with the swUpgradeCmd object for each SwUpgradeCmd value are listed below. - checkUpgrade, loadUpgrade: must also set swUpgradeAddress, swUpgradePath, swUpgradeFtpUser, swUpgradeFtpPswd and swUpgradeFileTransferType object values to indicate where the ftp or sftp server with the upgrade load files is to be found, along with access parameters. - invokeUpgrade, invokeScpUpgrade: must also set the swUpgradeInvokeRelNum object to confirm the software version that is to be used in the upgrade. The swUpgradeCheckAlm object may be set, but is not mandatory. - commitUpgrade, cancelUpgrade: no additional object values are required to be specified for these set requests."

The valid values for DataCommsPingCmd that can be used in a set operation are: - 'ping', used to trigger the ping operation over the OSC A value of 'pingInProgress' is returned when the dataCommsPingCmd object is read in a get operation if the ping command entered has not yet completed, otherwise 'noOp' is returned. In order for the set request on a DataCommsPingCmd object to complete successfully, the dataCommsPingCmd object, along with the dataCommdPingAddress and optionally the dataCommsPingNumAttemps objects must be set in the same set request for a given row of the table. The purpose of these objects is: - dataCommsPingAddress: indicates the IP Address which is the target of the ping operation - dataCommsPingNumAttempts: indicates how many ping attempts are to be made in the ping operation Once the dataCommsPingCmd operation is completed by way of the set operation on the dataCommsPingCmd and associated objects, the result of the operation is checked by performing a get operation on the dataCommsPingNumSuccesses object. When the ping operation completes, the value of this object will be set to the number of the attempted ping trials that resulted in a successful ping."

It can be utilized by an NMS to trigger LLDP remote systems table maintenance polls. Note that transmission of lldpRemTablesChange notifications are throttled by the agent. The agent must not generate more than one lldpRemTablesChange notification-event in the indicated period, where a 'notification-event' is the transmission of a single notification PDU type to a list of notification destinations. If additional changes in lldpRemoteSystemsData object groups occur within the indicated throttling period, then these trap- events must be suppressed by the agent. By default the throttling period is set to 10 seconds."
