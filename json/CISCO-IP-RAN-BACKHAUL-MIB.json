    "description": "This MIB provides information on the IP-RAN traffic from cell site to aggregation site in the following situations. In an GSM environment the cell site will be the Base station Transceiver System(BTS) and the aggregation site will be the Base Station Controller(BSC). In the UMTS environment the cell site will be the B-Node and the aggregation site will Radio Network Controller(RNC). There are two typical type backhaul, also know as longhaul, links. The traditional backhaul connection consists of a PPP multilink containing two or more E1 or T1 links or ATM or ATM/IMA. The alternate backhaul is traffic transported using IP cloud. Simple back-to-back configuration --------------------------------- This setup consists of two devices that support a limited number of GSM and UMTS links. They are deployed in pairs and inserted between the existing BTS device and BSC device.

The aggregate device has a seperate backhaul link to each BTS site.

The first and most important is the amount of traffic sent over the backhaul interface. The second is compression efficiency which has a direct impact amount of traffic placed backhaul link.
