The threshold values are described as the vsiAvailableChnlWarnThreshold and the vsiAvailableChnlAlarmThreshold objects. The vsiControllerIndex identifies the controller domain in which the threshold event took place. The vsiAvailableChnlThresholdStatus indicates the particular kind of threshold crossing that occurred.
