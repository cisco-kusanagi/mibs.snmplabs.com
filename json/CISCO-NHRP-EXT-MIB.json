    "description": "This MIB module is an extension of the NHRP MIB module as defined in RFC 2677. It defines notifications associated with critical events in the Next Hop Resolution Protocol, NHRP, as defined in RFC 2332. This module also contains information about Cisco proprietary enhancements to the protocol. Glossary of terms used in this MIB: NBMA Non-Broadcast Multi-Access NHRP Next Hop Resolution Protocol Internetwork layer The media-independent layer(IP in case of TCP/IP networks) Subnetwork layer The media-dependent layer underlying the internetwork layer, including the NBMA technology NHC Next Hop Client - An entity which initiates NHRP requests of various types to obtain access to NHRP service. NHS Next Hop Server - An entity providing the NHRP service within the NBMA cloud. NHRC Next Hop Registration Client - An entity which initiates NHRP registration requests. NHRS Next Hop Registration Server - An entity for which an NHRP registration request is destined. NHP Next Hop Peer - Any two NHRP entities in an NBMA network which are not related by an NHRS-NHRC relationship(either of them has not registered with the other) are NHPs to each other. Client Unless explicitly stated or obvious from context, a client refers to an NHC Server Unless explicitly stated or obvious from context, a server refers to an NHS Station A station refers to a host or router which contains an NHRP entity(NHC/NHS) NHRC and NHRS are relevant to a client server model based on registrations alone, in which NHRC is a client and NHRS is a server. In case the use of any term is not clear from context or not explicitly stated, they mean the same as in RFC 2332 and RFC 2677. REFERENCE: [1] RFC 2332 - NBMA Next Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP) [2] RFC 2677 - Definitions of Managed Objects for the NBMA Next Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP)"
