The address type in this table represents the address type used for the communication, irrespective of the higher-layer abstraction. For example, an application using IPv6 'sockets' to communicate via IPv4 between ::ffff:10.0.0.1 and ::ffff:10.0.0.2 would use InetAddressType ipv4(1). Like the udpTable in RFC 4113, this table also allows the representation of an application that completely specifies both local and remote addresses and ports. A listening application is represented in three possible ways: 1) An application that is willing to accept both IPv4 and IPv6 datagrams is represented by a udpliteEndpointLocalAddressType of unknown(0) and a udpliteEndpointLocalAddress of ''h (a zero-length octet-string). 2) An application that is willing to accept only IPv4 or only IPv6 datagrams is represented by a udpliteEndpointLocalAddressType of the appropriate address type and a udpliteEndpointLocalAddress of '0.0.0.0' or '::' respectively. 3) An application that is listening for datagrams only for a specific IP address but from any remote system is represented by a udpliteEndpointLocalAddressType of the appropriate address type, with udpliteEndpointLocalAddress specifying the local address. In all cases where the remote address is a wildcard, the udpliteEndpointRemoteAddressType is unknown(0), the udpliteEndpointRemoteAddress is ''h (a zero-length octet-string), and the udpliteEndpointRemotePort is 0. If the operating system is demultiplexing UDP-Lite packets by remote address/port, or if the application has 'connected' the socket specifying a default remote address/port, the udpliteEndpointRemote* values should be used to reflect this."
