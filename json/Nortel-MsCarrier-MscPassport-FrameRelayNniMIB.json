The chosen default class of routing applies to all outgoing calls established using this DNA, and applies to the packets travelling in both directions on all outgoing calls (local to remote, and remote to local). For incoming calls, the default class of routing is chosen by the calling party (as opposed to DPN, where either end of the call can choose the default routing class). This attribute, if set to a value of normal, indicates that the default class of routing is normal reliability routing. If set to a value of high, then the default class of routing is high reliability routing. High reliability is the standard choice for most DPN and Passport services. It usually indicates that packets are overflowed or retransmitted at various routing levels. Typically high reliability results in duplication and disordering of packets in the network when errors are detected or during link congestion. However, the VC handles the duplication and disordering to ensure that packets are delivered to the DTE properly. For the Frame Relay service, duplication of packets is not desired, in which case, normal reliability may be chosen as the preferred class of routing."

If only one CUG instance exists under a DNA, and if this CUG's attributes 'incCalls' and 'outCall' are both set to allowed, then this CUG instance can be changed to a SIMPLE CUG by setting the attribute 'preferential' to yes. If more than one CUG instances exist under a DNA, none of the CUGs can be set by the user as 'preferential'.

When operating with no LMI protocol, this attribute is always set to normalCondition. When operating with LMI procedures, this attribute is set to errorCondition after n392 of the last n393 events are in error. The consequence of an errorCondition is that all DLCIs on this interface will become inactive in both directions. The errorCondition is lifted and a normalCondition is indicated when a sufficient number of events have occurred without error. In ANSI, this occurs when n393 consecutive good events take place.

The value dependency indicates that the component cannot operate because some other resource on which it depends is unavailable. The operationalState is disabled. The value powerOff indicates the resource requires power to be applied and it is not powered on. The operationalState is disabled. The value offLine indicates the resource requires a routine operation (either manual, automatic, or both) to be performed to place it on-line and make it available for use. The operationalState is disabled. The value offDuty indicates the resource is inactive in accordance with a predetermined time schedule. In the absence of other disabling conditions, the operationalState is enabled or disabled. The value degraded indicates the service provided by the component is degraded in some way, such as in speed or operating capacity. However, the resource remains available for service.

The remote end must be defined as a permanentSlave, permanentBackupSlave, or permanentSlaveWithBackup. The connection cannot be established if the remote end is defined as anything else. The end defined as permanentMaster always initiates the calls. It attempts to call once per minute. If the value is set to permanentSlave then a permanent connection will be established between two ends. The remote end must be defined as a permanentMaster. The connection cannot be established if the remote end is defined as anything else. The permanentSlave end attempts to call once per minute. If the value is set to permanentSlaveWithBackup then a permanent connection will be established between the two ends. The remote end must be defined as a permanentMaster. The connection cannot be established if the remote interface is defined as anything else. The permanentSlaveWithBackup attempts to call once per minute. When type is set to permanentSlaveWithBackup, the connection is cleared if the interface becomes unavailable. This enables a retry of the connection which can be redirected to the permanentBackupSlave. If the value is set to permanentBackupSlave then a permanent connection is established between the two ends only if the permanentMaster end is disconnected from the permanentSlaveWithBackup end and a backup call is established by the call redirection system. If the permanentSlaveWithBackup interface becomes available again, the permanentBackupSlave end is disconnected and the permanentSlaveWithBackup end is reconnected to the permanentMaster end. The permanentBackupSlave end does not try to establish a call. If the value is set to spvcMaster, then a permanent connection is established between two ends, with resiliency at the NNI), if the connection transits across two or more networks. The remote end, which may be in the same network, or an external network that is reachable via Frame Relay NNIs, must be defined as either a spvcSlave, spvcBackupSlave or spvcSlaveWithBackup. The connection cannot be established if the remote end is defined as anything else. The end defined as spvcMaster always initiates the call. It attempts to call once per minute. The call is attempted by the spvcMaster and accepted by the remote end only if all of the following conditions are satisfied, at both ends: 1. The physical layer must be operational. 2. The LMI procedures must be in normalCondition (that is, no service affecting condition). 3. If the LMI side attribute is provisioned to both, the A-bit received from the interface must be Active. If the LMI side attribute is not provisioned to both, this condition does not apply. After a call is cleared, the spvcMaster end attempts to retry the call according to the rule for the clear cause. If the call is cleared or rejected due to the failure of one of the three conditions indicated above, or due to unavailability of resources along any point in the connection path, the call will be retried after 60 seconds. For all other causes, such as loss of service at an NNI, the call will be retried immediately. If the value is set to spvcSlave then an SPVC connection is established between two ends. The remote end must be defined as an spvcMaster. The connection cannot be established if the remote end is defined as anything else. The spvcSlave end does not attempt to call. If the value is set to spvcSlaveWithBackup then a SPVC connection is established between the two ends. The remote end must be defined as an spvcMaster. The connection cannot be established if the remote interface end is defined as anything else. Unlike a permanentSlaveWithBackup end, the spvcSlaveWithBackup end does not attempt to call. If the value is set to spvcSlaveWithBackup, the connection is cleared if the interface becomes unavailable. This enables a retry of the connection by the spvcMaster end, which may be redirected to an end that is set to spvcBackupSlave. If the value is set to spvcBackupSlave then an SPVC connection is established between the two ends only if the spvcMaster end is disconnected from the spvcSlaveWithBackup end, and a backup call is redirected by the call redirection system. Unlike the PVC connection, if the spvcSlaveWithBackup interface becomes available again, the spvcBackupSlave end is not disconnected and the spvcSlaveWithBackup end is not reconnected to the spvcMaster end. Neither the spvcBackupSlave nor the spvcSlaveWithBackup ends try to establish an SPVC call."

Two explicit attributes discardPriority and pathSensitivity are created to replace H.01 and H.30 in the group VcsDirectCallOptionsProv of this file. The migrate escape here (DcComponent::migrateFaxEscape) propagates the old provisioning data under H.01 and H.30 into discardPriority and transferPriority. The rule of the above propagation are: 0 in H.01 is equivalent to discardPriority 0; 1 in H.01 is equivalent to discardPriority 1. And 0 in H.30 is equivalent to transferPriority throughput; 1 in H.30 is equivalent to pathSensitivity delay. Please refer to discardPriority and pathSensitivity for more information on how to use them."

The purpose of Vc attributes is to aid end users and verification people to understand the Vc internal behavior. This is particularly useful when the network has experienced abnormality and we want to isolate problems and pinpoint trouble spots. Attributes are collected on a per Vc basis. Until a need is identified, statistics are not collected at a processor level. Each attribute is stored in a 32 bit field and is initialized to zero when a Vc enters into the data transfer state. When a PVC is disconnected and then connected again, the attributes will be reset. Attributes cannot be reset through other methods. Frame Relay Vc uses a best effort data packet delivery protocol and a different packet segmentation and combination methods from the General Vc. The Frame Relay Vc uses the same call setup and control mechanism (e.g. the support of non-flow control data packets) as in a General Vc. Most General Vc statistics and internal variables are used in a Frame Relay Vc and are displayed by software developers"

Rate adaptation is a feature that, in periods of congestion, adapts the rate at which the user is allowed to send data into the network to that which the network is able to handle at that time. This pro-active measure of handling congestion optimizes network resources by causing the ingress to discard frames that would otherwise be discarded in the network. If this attribute is set to on, then, at the onset of congestion, the excess information rate (EIR) is reduced to a very low rate. If congestion persists, then the allowed CIR is reduced geometrically by 25% of the current value at that time. The minimum to which CIR can be reduced is 1/16th (6.25%) of the provisioned value. As congestion alleviates, CIR is increased linearly by 6.25% of the provisioned value specified in committedInformationRate. If set to eirOnly, then rate adaptation will only apply to the excess information rate (EIR). At the onset of congestion, the allowed EIR is reduced by 25% of its provisioned value. If congestion persists, EIR is reduced geometrically by 25% of the current value at that time. As congestion alleviates, EIR is gradually increased linearly by 6.25% of the provisioned EIR. If set to cirProportionate, then rate adaptation will also only apply to the excess information rate (EIR). At the onset of congestion the initial allowed EIR is set to a multiple of the provisioned CIR. If congestion persists, the allowed EIR is reduced geometrically by 25% of the current value at that time. As congestion alleviates, EIR is gradually increased linearly by 6.25% of the provisioned EIR. Note that the allowed EIR may be set higher than the provisioned EIR, since it is calculated initially using another parameter, the provisioned CIR. If the allowed EIR at the moment is higher than the provisioned EIR, then the provisioned EIR is used instead. This attribute can only be set to on eirOnly or cirProportionate if rateEnforcement is turned on."

A higher setting therefore tends to favour the protection of the network over the allowed throughput of the user. A lower number indicates a lower sensitivity and therefore a slower reaction to network conditions. A slower reaction time results in a greater amount of user traffic allowed into the network, but can lead to a waste of network bandwidth since the traffic may be discarded at the congested resource. A lower setting therefore tends to favour the allowed throughput of the user over the protection of the network.

Rate adaptation is a feature that, in periods of congestion, adapts the rate at which the user is allowed to send data into the network to that which the network is able to handle at that time. This proactive measure of handling congestion optimizes network resources by causing the ingress to discard frames that would otherwise be discarded in the network. If this attribute is set to on, then, at the onset of congestion, the excess information rate (EIR) is reduced to a very low rate. If congestion persists, then the allowed CIR is reduced geometrically by 25% of the current value at that time. The minimum to which CIR can be reduced is 1/16th (6.25%) of the provisioned value. As congestion alleviates, CIR is increased linearly by 6.25% of the provisioned value specified in committedInformationRate. If set to eirOnly, then rate adaptation will only apply to the excess information rate (EIR). At the onset of congestion, the allowed EIR is reduced by 25% of its provisioned value. If congestion persists, EIR is reduced geometrically by 25% of the current value at that time. As congestion alleviates, EIR is gradually increased linearly by 6.25% of the provisioned EIR. If set to cirProportionate, then rate adaptation will also only apply to the excess information rate (EIR). At the onset of congestion the initial allowed EIR is set to a multiple of the provisioned CIR. If congestion persists, the allowed EIR is reduced geometrically by 25% of the current value at that time. As congestion alleviates, EIR is gradually increased linearly by 6.25% of the provisioned EIR. Note that the allowed EIR may be set higher than the provisioned EIR, since it is calculated initially using another parameter, the provisioned CIR. If the allowed EIR at the moment is higher than the provisioned EIR, then the provisioned EIR is used instead. This attribute can only be set to on or eirOnly if rateEnforcement is set to on."

A quicker reaction time allows the network to discard frames at the access and protect network resources, but can lead to false alarms and a greater fluctuation of the allowed rate. A higher setting therefore tends to favor the protection of the network over the allowed throughput of the user. A lower number indicates a lower sensitivity and therefore a slower reaction to network conditions. A slower reaction time results in a greater amount of user traffic allowed into the network, but can lead to a waste of network bandwidth since the traffic may be discarded at the congested resource. A lower setting therefore tends to favour the allowed throughput of the user over the protection of the network.
