    "description": "The main purpose of this MIB is to provide product component level configuration, status, statistics, events, and alarm notifications for the Cisco TelePresence Exchange System (CTX System). A network management entity can use this MIB to: - Discover cluster nodes - Discover resources and their configurations - Monitor status of all cluster nodes - Monitor status of resources - Monitor configuration status - Monitor license status - Monitor backup process status - Monitor scheduling allocation failures and port usage statistics - Monitor product level error events - Receive real time notifications for status change and error ********************************* System Overview ********************************* Cisco TelePresence Exchange System (CTX System) is a turnkey solution tailored to service providers who want to offer premium video collaboration services and TelePresence as a service to enterprise customers. The CTX System solution preserves the full TelePresence experience across enterprise and service provider boundaries, integrates with third party SD/HD video technology, and maximizes service and network value via tight integration with other Cisco video and unified collaboration products. The Cisco TelePresence Exchange is comprised of a variety of components in order to deliver a highly integrated video service platform that will meet the needs of the service provider. At the heart of the exchange is what we refer to as the core components that are standards based platforms containing custom software to deliver the majority of the systems services and functions. These core components are the Cisco TelePresence Exchange System. ********************************* System Components ********************************* The core components are broken down into three application functional areas; administration, call processing, and persistent data storage. Each application is run on a dedicated server. Each dedicated server has a backup server. For each CTX System there are six servers. The collection of servers are considered a cluster and the servers are considered nodes within the cluster. The below diagram illustrates the CTX System: Cisco TelePresence Exchange System (CTX System) /--------------------------------------------\\ | --------------- --------------- | | | Admin 1 | <----> | Admin 2 | | | --------------- --------------- | | | | | | --------------- --------------- | | | Call Engine 1 | <----> | Call Engine 2 | | | --------------- --------------- | | | | | | --------------- --------------- | | | Database 1 | <----> | Database 2 | | | --------------- --------------- | \\--------------------------------------------/ The overall system requires a number of other Cisco platforms to deliver an end-to-end solution. These other platforms are configured in the CTX System as resources. ********************************* Implementation ********************************* The administration servers provide management interfaces for the CTX System cluster nodes and for the resources configured. This MIB consolidates the configuration, status, alarms, errors, and statistics for all cluster nodes. Therefore this MIB will only be implemented on the admin servers. Each admin server can be polled independently or via a virtual IP address. Each admin server functions in an active/active mode with the same set of information. Hardware and operating system level information, such as CPU, memory, power supplies, fans, etc. remain accessible in hardware and operating system specific MIBS, such as HOST-RESOURCES-MIB, IF-MIB, ... ********************************* Configuration Tables and Linking ********************************* Configuration table hierarchal structure is as follows: ___ |- Cluster Nodes - CTX System devices | |- Service Providers - Logical grouping |-- Regions - Logical grouping | | | |--- Resources - General configs for resources | | that are common to all resources | | | |--- SIP Configs - SIP configurations such as | | SIP IP, port, and protocol | | | |--- Meeting Configs - Meeting configurations | | such as Min/Max meeting ID's | | | |--- Capacity Configs - Media port counts, | | large meeting support, etc. | |-- Organizations All configuration table entries have a globally unique key. No two keys will be the same within or across configuration tables. The intent is to allow network management applications to use these unique keys to link or join associated tables together. Configuration tables that have an association to another table will contain a key reference object. Multiple associations may exist, so the key reference will contain a number in the object name. This number indicates only that there are multiple associations. The reference key object name will have the appended syntax 'KeyRef1'. Optionally there maybe 'KeyRef2', etc. when multiple associations exist. Example of linking associated tables: REGION TABLE Entry: ctxRegionKey.1 = STRING: 8a960c882aa5cd64012aa5d3963b0028 ctxRegionName.1 = STRING: San Francisco ctxRegionDescr.1 = STRING: null ctxRegionServiceProviderKeyRef1.1 = STRING: 8a960c882aa5cd64012aa5d144730017 RESOURCE TABLE Entry: ctxResourceKey.1 = STRING: 8a960c882aca4db8012aca9bbdb401dd ctxResourceName.1 = STRING: abc-cuvcm ctxResourceDescr.1 = STRING: abc-cuvcm ctxResourceMgmtIPType.1 = INTEGER: ipv4(1) ctxResourceMgmtIPAddr.1 = STRING: 0.0.0.0 ctxResourceDeviceType.1 = INTEGER: cuvcm(9) ctxResourceRegionKeyRef1.1 = STRING: 8a960c882aa5cd64012aa5d3963b0028 For the above entry we can see that there is a ctxResourceRegionKeyRef1 that has the ctxRegionKey value for region 'San Francisco' . Therefore resource 'abc-cuvcm' is associated to region 'San Francisco' ********************************* Glossary ********************************* CTX System : Cisco TelePresence Exchange System Service Provider : A service provider is configured in the CTX System and serves as a logical grouping of configuration objects. Region : A region is defined as a set of 'like' resources in terms of network latency, jitter, quality of service, etc. Normally a region is a geographic area such as Americas, Europe, or Asia Pacific, but a region can be a smaller set of like resources such as East and West regions. Resource : A resource is server or network device that the CTX System includes in configuration to provide call signaling, media services, scheduling, or other function. Cluster Node: A cluster node is a server within the CTX System, such as admin server, call engine server, or database server. SIP Protocol: SIP protocol is the transport protocol used to exchange messages between user agents. The protocols are described in RFC3261. Port : Port is the media session port allocation, also referred to as screen E.164 : E.164 is an ITU-T recommendation for telephone numbers.
