    "description": "The Cisco Unified Multi-Modal Contact Applications (MMCA) platform is a highly scalable, modular, extensible, open and secure platform for providing contact center applications. The Cisco Unified Expert Advisor (CUEA) is implemented on this platform. The Cisco Unified Expert Advisor application is deployed on multiple devices that form a cluster, where each device could be classified as 'Runtime' or 'Reporting'. Each device hosts a set of services and each service performs a specific task. Not all services will be running on every device. The CISCO-MMODAL-CONTACT-APPS-MIB defines the instrumentation of the services present in the Cisco Unified Expert Advisor. The MIB mainly consists of the run-time statistics of each service and also defines a Notification format. It also defines various groups of objects that are not specific to a service. DEFINITION OF TERMS AND ACRONYMS ACD Automatic Call Distributor ACMI Advanced Contact Management Interface. The interface used by the ICM to talk to generic peripherals. Also known as GED-188 Agent An Agent, also known as Expert Advisor, is a person in the enterprise who is capable of handling calls from CUEA AQ Assignment Queue Assignment Queue Assignment Queues allow Cisco Unified ICM to route call requests to groups of expert advisors. Various experts may qualify for various assignment queues based on the assignment queue membership rules, and they then log in or out of, as well as change their availability with respect to those assignment queues. An expert advisor who is available on a given assignment queue is able to be considered by the Work Assigner to receive calls according to the assignment queue's selection strategy. Attribute Definition Attributes Definitions are used by assignment queues and expert advisors. Attributes are defined by CUEA administrators and assigned to assignment queues and expert advisors. Expert advisors are routed call requests if the expert advisor's skills and attributes match those of the Assignment Queue. B2BUA Back to back user agent CM Contact Manager Contact A Contact is the internal object that represents an internal call. The Contact is created when the call arrives at CUEA, and does not terminate until the caller disconnects CTI Computer Telephony Integration CTI-OS Computer Telephony Integration - Object Server CUEA Cisco Unified Expert Advisor CUCM Cisco Unified Communications manager CUPS Cisco Unified Presence server CVP Customer Voice Portal DNIS Dialed Number Identification service ERS Enterprise Routing Services.

    "description": "This textual convention is used to identify the type of service. The Cisco Unified Expert Advisor includes one or but probably multiple, of the following services. 'cm': Contact Manager: The Contact manager service is responsible for the handling of call requests and maintaining contact state. CM uses BRE to help direct call flow decision making. The major services that the CM interfaces with are the Work Assigner (WA), Media Platform Interface (MPA), Knowledge Broker (KB), the ICM Gateway (GW), and Business Rules Execution Engine (BRE). 'rm': Resource Manager: The Resource Manager (RM) is responsible for maintaining the state of assignable resources, e.g. agents. The RM interfaces to the Work Assigner, Media Platform Interface, Resource Desktop Adapter and Business Rules Engine. 'wa': Work assigner: The Work Asssigner is responsible for matching Contacts that need Resources with Resources that need Contacts. 'mpa': Media Platform Adapter: The Media Platform Adapter is a generic interface to various switching and call control platforms. Removes inconsistencies and normalizes messages before sending them. It is an SIP Back to Back user Agent, providing basic third party call control and end point functions to its clients(RM,CM,RDA). 'bre': Business Rules Engine: The BRE allows customers to define how the system will behave and then execute scripts or business rules at runtime. 'icmgw': ICM Gateway : The ICM Gateway talks to the ERS PG of ICM over the GED-188 (ACMI) protocol. It sends agent state information to the ICM so that the ICM knows whether or not to route calls. 'rda': Resource Desktop Adapter: This service is used by RM to communicate to the user interface of the Resource(Agent). It provides a normalized interface (RDI) to the RM that removes differences between communicating to different types of desktops or Resources viz;CTI-OS, Presence, WebBased desktops or Traditional/occasional agents. 'ra': Reporting Adapter: RAs listen to event streams that are produced by runtime components. They then take those events, convert them as appropriate (for example, converting them to a particular version of a schema or applying a security policy of what data can be sent to the reporting database) and then send a new message to the Cisco MMCA Reporting Subsystem. 'rs': Reporting Subsystem: The RS is responsible for writing data into the reporting database. It receives messages from various Reporting Adapters and converts them into db writes."

'inService' The service is up and running optimally, accepting connections at full QoS (if applicable). 'inServiceWarning' The service is running sub-optimally, possibly due to poor QoS or a threshold reached; see transition reason for explanation. 'inServiceCritical' The service is running but very near to failure, similar to 'inServiceWarning' but much more dire. 'partialService' The service is no longer accepting new calls but finishes processing active calls (may be due to a loss of a dependency/ connectivity, or a shutdown request). 'outOfService' The service is no longer accepting new calls and is down for some reason. It can still be brought in service. 'stopping' The service no longer accepts new connections, lets current connections terminate gracefully. 'stopped' The service has shut down and is not processing any more calls. The process itself is terminating (doing memory cleanup, saving settings, shutting down threads, etc.). 'unknown' The status of the mmca service is unknown to the SNMP agent either because the link between the agent and the application has been broken or the agent is in the midst of refreshing service status.

Instances may load share as well as support different types of contacts. This service is a critical funnel point to the rest of the system. CM uses BRE to help direct call flow decision making. The CM must be able to transparently scale and provide for fault tolerance. This is best modeled as the CM receiving work from a virtual queue. The CM only participates within a single routing domain, and therefore only talks to a single Work Assigner. Each CM is also tied to a single MPA. The BRE used by the CM can be shared among components (both CMs and RMs). This table has a sparse dependent relationship with the cmmcaServiceTable and hence uses its index."

This type of communication typically includes requests like: - Log In or Log Out a resource from the desktop - Set the presence state of the desktop to a particular state - Show a precall message to the resource - Offer a task to the resource and get a response Each RDA is tied to a single Resource Manager, but each Resource Manager may talk to many RDAs.

The Work Assigner is responsible for matching Contacts that need Resources with Resources that need Contacts. The scope of a single work assigner defines a Routing Domain. A Routing Domain is a set of Contacts and a set of Resources that can be assigned to each other. This means that the size of a routing domain is constrained by how scalable a Work Assigner can be. Because of this, the Work Assigner tries to be as streamlined as possible and delegate all logic that deals with the scope of an individual resource or individual contact to the RM or the CM. Work Assigner is not the only interface that is used to communicate between the RM and the CM, it merely provides the initial assignment between the two , much in the same manner as a SIP connects two endpoints, and then gets out of the call. The Work Assigner also includes the logic to execute advanced routing features (such as resume routing, spatial routing, etc). This table has a sparse dependent relationship with cmmcaServiceTable and hence is indexed by cmmcaServiceIndex."

This message is sent using durability and persistence to ensure that the message will get to the Reporting Subsystem (RS). Reporting Adapters run on the same Device as the runtime components that they are monitoring. This is because the events that are being produced are delivered on a best-effort basis, and being on the same Device (and in the same JVM) ensures that the adapter will receive the event.

It sends agent state information to the ICM so that the ICM knows whether or not to route calls to Cisco Unified Expert Advisor and if so to which skill groups, i.e. assignment queues. Another critical function is to allow translation routing of calls from ICM and getting call context information from those calls into CUEA. Unlike a conventional ACD, the ICM Gateway doesnt track individual calls and generate every call event to the PIM. Instead, it relays agent status events to the ERS PG, and the PG is then able to fabricate real-time agent/skill-group reports and sends to the ICM Central Controller. The ICM Gateway also forwards call termination details to the PG and based on those the modified OPC at the PG can create half-hour reports. This table has a sparse dependent relationship with cmmcaServiceTable and hence uses its index."
