    "description": "Reference: NID2982 This MIB specifies objects for configuring Ethernet-like services and devices. It models trail termination points (TTPs) for Ethernet Transport Service as virtual interfaces. It also includes objects for configuration of the physical interfaces (ports). 1+1 protected transport is provided using virtual interfaces as interface groups. Physical and logical interfaces are connected to Forwarding Functions. The configuration model consists of the following primary tables: ethDeviceTable. This table contains one entry for every device (board). Its primary function is to provide capability information about the objects such as forwarding functions and interfaces on the device. ethIfTable. Table with all interfaces, both physical (dot3), logical (ETS), and virtual ports as interface group. The table contains an entry for every port. It contains configuration objects common to all port types. ethDot3Table. Table that contains an entry for every physical port. The table holds the data related to the physical port. Note that the port is also represented in the ethIfTable, and is referenced by the same index in both tables. ethEtsTable. Table that contains one entry for every Ethernet Transport Service Trail Termination Point (ETS TTP). A TTP is used to connect a port to a remote port using a connection over the DTM network. Note that the port is also represented in the ethIfTable, and is referenced by the same index in both tables. ethIfgTable. This table contains one entry for every interface group. An interface group is a virtual port that represents the transport over two paths to a remote interface group for 1+1 protected transport. The two paths are implemented using two ports from the ethEtsTable. ethFwdFuncTable. This table contains an entry for every forwarding function. Physical and ETS ports must be associated with a forwarding function. The forwarding function then forwards Ethernet frames between the different associated ports. Configuration objects on the forwarding function and the associated interfaces control how frames are forwarded to the different ports. In addition to the primary tables, there are some other tables: ethFwdDiffservTable. Configuration of differentiated service code points to flow group map for a forwarding function. ethIfQueueTable. Configuration of a port's queues. ethIfQDropThresholdTable. Configuration of drop thresholds for combination of traffic class and drop precedence per interface. ethIfVLANSetsTable. Configuration of a the port's VLAN membership. ethEtsTConnectionTable. References to connections that are terminating in a Trail Termination Point. ethEtsIndexLookupTable. Reverse-lookup of an entry in the ethEtsTable based on known DSTI. The following two tables contains information regarding the Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol: ethFwdRstpTable. The table contains data related to the bridge for the Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol. This table is indexed with the same index as the ethFwdTable. ethIfRstpTable. The table contains data related to the port for the Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol. This table is indexed with the same index as the ethIfTable (and ethDot3Table and ethEtsTable)."
