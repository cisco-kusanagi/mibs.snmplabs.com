The following are the abbreviations for the baseline documents: [CFM] refers to 'Connectivity Fault Management', IEEE 802.1ag-2007, December 2007 [MEF7.1] refers to MEF 7.1 'Phase 2 EMS-NMS Information Model', October 2009 [MEF17] refers to MEF 17 'Service OAM Requirements & Framework - Phase 1', April 2007 [MEF10.2.1] refers to MEF 10.2.1 'Ethernet Services Attributes Phase 2', January 2011 [MEF SOAM-PM] refers to MEF 35 'Service OAM Performance Monitoring Implementation Agreement', January 2012 [MEF SOAM-FM] refers to MEF 30 'Service OAM Fault Management Implementation Agreement', January 2011 [Q.840.1] refers to 'ITU-T Requirements and analysis for NMS-EMS management interface of Ethernet over Transport and Metro Ethernet Network (EoT/MEN)', March 2007 [Y.1731] refers to ITU-T Y.1731 'OAM functions and mechanisms for Ethernet based networks', February 2011 **************************************************************************** Abbreviations Used Term Definition Availability Performance A measure of the percentage of time within a specified time interval during which the frame loss is small Backward OAM information sent from the Responder MEP to the Controller MEP. For LM it indicates the frame counts/loss from the Responder MEP to the Controller MEP. For DM is indicates the delay and delay variation from the Responder MEP to the Controller MEP. BSS Business Support System CCM Continuity Check Message CFM Connectivity Fault Management CHLI Consecutive High Loss Interval, a sequence of small time intervals contained in T, each with high frame loss ratio Controller MEP The Controller MEP initiates SOAM PDUs, and receives responses from the Responder MEP. CoS Class of Service DM Delay Measurement Dual-Ended A type of process where a MEP sends measurement information to a peer MEP that will perform the calculations. EMS Element Management System ETH-DM Ethernet Delay Measurement function ETH-LM Ethernet Loss Measurement function ETH-SLM Ethernet Synthetic Frame Loss Measurement function EVC Ethernet Virtual Connection FD Frame Delay FDR Frame Delay Range FLR Frame Loss Ratio FM Fault Management Forward OAM information sent from the Controller MEP to the Responder MEP. For LM it indicates the frame counts/loss from the Controller MEP to the Responder MEP. For DM is indicates the delay and delay variation from the Controller MEP to the Responder MEP. HLI High Loss Interval, a small time interval contained in T with a high frame loss ratio IEEE Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IETF Internet Engineering Task Force IFDV Inter-Frame Delay Variation ITU-T International Telecommunication Union - Telecommunication Standardization Bureau LAN Local Area Network LM Loss Measurement MAC Media Access Control MA Maintenance Association (equivalent to a MEG) MD Maintenance Domain (equivalent to a OAM Domain in MEF 17) MD Level Maintenance Domain Level (equivalent to a MEG level) ME Maintenance Entity Measurement Bin A Measurement Bin is a counter that stores the number of performance measurements falling within a specified range, during a Measurement Interval Measurement Interval A period of time during which measurements are taken. Measurements initiated during one Measurement Interval are kept separate from measurements taken during other Measurement Intervals. It is important to note that this is different from T. MEF Metro Ethernet Forum MEG Maintenance Entity Group (equivalent to a MA) MEG Level Maintenance Entity Group Level (equivalent to MD Level) MEN Metro Ethernet Network MEP Maintenance Association End Point or MEG End Point MFD Mean Frame Delay MIB Management Information Base MIP Maintenance Domain Intermediate Point or MEG Intermediate Point MP Maintenance Point. One of either a MEP or a MIP NE Network Element NMS Network Management System OAM Operations, Administration, and Maintenance On-Demand OAM actions that are initiated via manual intervention for a limited time to carry out diagnostics. On-Demand OAM can result in singular or periodic OAM actions during the diagnostic time interval One-way A measurement performed in the forward or backward direction. For example from MEP A to MEP B or from MEP B to MEP A. OSS Operations Support System PDU Protocol Data Unit PM Performance Monitoring PM Function A MEP capability specified for performance monitoring purposes (e.g., Single-Ended Delay, Single-Ended Synthetic Loss) PM Session A PM Session is the application of a given PM Function between a given pair of MEPs and using a given CoS Frame Set over some (possibly indefinite) period of time. PM Solution A PM Solution is a set of related requirements that when implemented allow a given set of performance metrics to be measured using a given set of PM functions. PM Tool A generic term used to discuss the application of a PM Function. Proactive OAM actions that are carried on continuously to permit timely reporting of fault and/or performance status. Resiliency Performance The number of High Loss Intervals and Consecutive High Loss Intervals in T Responder MEP In a single-ended session, the Responder MEP receives SOAM PDUs, from the Controller MEP, and transmits a response to the Controller MEP. SOAM-PM RFC Request for Comment Service Frame An Ethernet frame transmitted across the UNI toward the Service Provider or an Ethernet frame transmitted across the UNI toward the Subscriber Single-Ended A type of process where a MEP sends a measurement request and the peer MEP replies with the requested information so the originating MEP can calculate the measurement. Sink MEP In a dual-ended session, the Sink MEP receives SOAM PDUs, from the Controller MEP and performs the performance calculations. SLM Synthetic Loss Measurement SNMP Simple Network Management Protocol SNMP Agent An SNMP entity containing one or more command responder and/or notification originator applications (along with their associated SNMP engine). Typically implemented in an NE. SNMP Manager An SNMP entity containing one or more command generator and/or notification receiver applications (along with their associated SNMP engine). Typically implemented in an EMS or NMS. SOAM Service OAM SOAM PDU Service OAM frame, or Protocol Data Unit. Specifically, those PDUs defined in [IEEE 802.1ag], [ITU-T Y.1731], or MEF specifications Synthetic Traffic SOAM traffic that emulates service traffic in order to measure the performance experience. Delay measurements must use synthetic traffic, because user traffic does not contain standardized timestamp fields. Other measurements, such as Frame Loss, may also use synthetic frames for certain advantages (e.g., ability to measure loss in multipoint services). T Time Interval for SLS Metrics. The time over which a Performance Metric is defined. T is at least as large as the Measurement Interval, and generally consists of multiple Measurement Intervals. TC Textual Conventions TLV Type Length Value, a method of encoding Objects Two-way A measurement of the performance of frames that flow from the Controller MEP to Responder MEP and back again.

    "description": "This table includes configuration objects for the Delay Measurement bins to collect stats. Each row in the table is automatically created when the Delay Measurement session is defined for the selected MEP. The number of rows created is based upon three items: the DM type, the number of bins defined for each type, and whether bins are enabled for each type. The first four indices are the same as used to create the DM session: Maintenance Domain, MaNet, MEP identification, and mefSoamDmCfgIndex. The fifth index is the type of bin, and the sixth index is the bin number. For a dmDmm session all nine types of bins can be created. For a dm1DmmTx session no bins are created. For a dm1DmmRx session only types forwardFrameDelay, forwardIfdv, and forwardFrameDelayRange can be created. The number of bins created for a bin type is based upon: the mefSoamDmCfgNumMeasBinsPerFrameDelayInterval object, the mefSoamDmCfgNumMeasBinsPerInterFrameDelayVariationInterval object, the mefSoamDmCfgNumMeasBinsPerFrameDelayRangeInterval object, and the mefSoamDmCfgMeasurementEnable object. For instance, if a dmDmm session with Bins per Frame Delay Interval set to 5, Bins per Frame Delay Variation Interval set to 3, and Frame Delay Range set to 2 (default), all of the appropriate bits set in mefSoamDmMeasurementCfgEnable, the following number of rows would be created: For bin types TwoWayFrameDelay(1), forwardFrameDelay(2), and backwardFrameDelay(3) = 5 bins * 3 types = 15 rows For bin types TwoWayIfdv(4), forwardIfdv(5), backwardIfdv(6) = 3 bins * 3 types = 9 rows. For bins types twoWayFrameDelayRange(7), forwardFrameDelayRange(8), backwardFrameDelayRange(9) = 2 bins * 3 types = 6 rows. This gives a total of 30 rows created for the DMM session example. Each value in the bin defaults to 5000us greater than the previous bin, with the first bin default value set to 0. For the delay example above (5 bins), the following default values would be written to the bins: bin 1: 0 (range is 0us <= measurement < 5,000us) bin 2: 5000 (range is 5,000us <= measurement < 10,000us) bin 3: 10000 (range is 10,000us <= measurement < 15,000us) bin 4: 15000 (range is 15,000us <= measurement < 20,000us) bin 5: 20000 (range is 20,000us <= measurement < infinity) For the delay variation example above (3 bins), the following default values would be written to the bins: bin 1: 0 (range is 0us <= measurement < 5,000us) bin 2: 5000 (range is 5,000us <= measurement < 10,000us) bin 3: 10000 (range is 10,000us <= measurement < infinity) For the frame delay range example above (2 bins), the following default values would be written to the bins: bin 1: 0 (range is 0us <= measurement < 5,000us) bin 2: 5000 (range is 5,000us <= measurement < infinity) The writable objects in this table need to be persistent upon reboot or restart of a device. Rows are only created if the corresponding measurement type has been enabled via the mefSoamDmCfgMeasurementEnable object. "

The main purpose of the threshold configuration table is to configure threshold alarm notifications indicating that a specific performance metric is not being met. Each row in the table represents a Loss Measurement session threshold set for the defined MEP. This table uses five indices. The first three indices are the indices of the Maintenance Domain, MaNet, and MEP tables. The fourth index is the specific LM session on the selected MEP. The fifth index is the specific threshold set number. Rows in this table are not created automatically. A row is created in this table to set up a threshold set on a configured MEP that has a configured LM session. If two managers try to 'create' the same row at the same time, the first creation would succeed, the second creation attempt would result in an error. The second creation attempt would then need to select a new index value to successfully create a new row. An NE needs to support at least one threshold set for NE SOAM PM compliance. A second threshold set on the NE is desirable. More than two threshold sets can be configured on the NE if supported on the NE. All the objects in the row have a default value that disables the particular threshold measurement. In order to enable a threshold measurement the particular bit in the mefSoamLmThresholdCfgEnable object is to be set to '1' and the selected threshold measurement is to have a threshold value configured. Non-configured threshold measurements are disabled by default. The writable objects in this table need to be persistent upon reboot or restart of a device. "

The main purpose of the threshold configuration table is to configure threshold alarm notifications indicating that a specific performance metric is not being met. Each row in the table represents a Delay Measurement session threshold set for the defined MEP. This table uses five indices. The first three indices are the indices of the Maintenance Domain, MaNet, and MEP tables. The fourth index is the specific DM session on the selected MEP. The fifth index is the specific threshold set number. Rows in this table are not created automatically. A row is created in this table to set up a threshold set on a configured MEP that has a configured DM session. An NE needs to support at least one threshold set for NE SOAM PM compliance. A second threshold set on the NE is desirable. More than two threshold sets on the NE can be configured if supported on the NE. All the objects in the row have a default value that disables the particular threshold measurement. In order to enable a threshold measurement the particular bit in the mefSoamDmThresholdCfgEnable object is to be set to '1' and the selected threshold measurement is to have a threshold value configured. Non-configured threshold measurements are disabled by default. The writable objects in this table need to be persistent upon reboot or restart of a device. "
