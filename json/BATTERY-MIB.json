Typically, these modules include an identifier that can be retrieved by a device in which a battery has been installed. The identifier is useful when batteries are removed and reinstalled in the same or other devices. Then, the device or the network management system can trace batteries and achieve continuity of battery monitoring. If the battery is identified by more than one value, for example, by a model number and a serial number, then the value of this object is a concatenation of these values, separated by the colon symbol ':'. The values should be ordered so that a more significant value comes before a less significant one. In the example above, the (more significant) model number would be first, and the serial number would follow: '<model number>:<serial number>'. If the battery identifier cannot be represented using the ISO/IEC IS 10646-1 character set, then a hexadecimal encoding of a binary representation of the entire battery identifier must be used.

See the definition of object batteryChargingOperState for a description of the values. When this object is initialized by an implementation of the BATTERY-MIB module, its value is set to notSet(1). In this case, the charging controller is free to choose which operational state is suitable. When the batteryChargingAdminState object is set, then the BATTERY-MIB implementation must try to set the battery to the indicated state. The result will be indicated by object batteryChargingOperState. Setting object batteryChargingAdminState to value notSet(1) is a request to the charging controller to operate autonomously and choose the operational state that is suitable. Setting object batteryChargingAdminState to value charge(2) is a request to enter the operational state charging(2) until the battery is fully charged. When the battery is fully charged, or if the battery was already fully charged or almost fully charged at the time of the request, the operational state will change to maintainingCharge(3) if the charging controller and the battery support the functionality of maintaining the charge, or it will change to noCharging(4) otherwise. Setting object batteryChargingAdminState to value doNotCharge(3) is a request for entering operational state noCharging(4). Setting object batteryChargingAdminState to value discharge(4) is a request for entering operational state discharging(5). Discharging can be accomplished by ordinary use, applying a dedicated load, or any other means. An example for applying this state is battery maintenance. If the battery is empty or almost empty, the operational state will change to noCharging(4). The charging controller will decide which charge condition will be considered empty dependent on the battery technology used. This is done to avoid damage on the battery due to deep discharge. Due to operational conditions and limitations of the implementation of the BATTERY-MIB module, changing the battery status according to a set value of object batteryChargingAdminState may not be possible. Setting the value of object batteryChargingAdminState may result in not changing the state of the battery to this value or even in setting the charging state to another value than the requested one. For example, the charging controller might at any time decide to enter state discharging(5), if there is an operational need to use the battery for supplying power."
