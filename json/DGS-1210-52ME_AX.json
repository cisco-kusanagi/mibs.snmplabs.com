Several objects in this MIB module represent values of timers used by the Spanning Tree Protocol. In this MIB, these timers have values in units of hundreths of a second (i.e. 1/100 secs). These timers, when stored in a Spanning Tree Protocol's BPDU, are in units of 1/256 seconds. Note, however, that 802.1D-1990 specifies a settable granularity of no more than 1 second for these timers. To avoid ambiguity, a data type is defined here as a textual convention and all representation of these timers in this MIB module are defined using this data type. An algorithm is also defined for converting between the different units, to ensure a timer's value is not distorted by multiple conversions."

    "description": "The status of a table entry. Setting this object to the value invalid(4) has the effect of invalidating the corresponding entry. That is, it effectively disassociates the mapping identified with said entry. It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table. Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to receive tabular information from agents that corresponds to entries currently not in use. Proper interpretation of such entries requires examination of the relevant RmonStatus object. An existing instance of this object cannot be set to createRequest(2). This object may only be set to createRequest(2) when this instance is created. When this object is created, the agent may wish to create supplemental object instances with default values to complete a conceptual row in this table. Because the creation of these default objects is entirely at the option of the agent, the manager must not assume that any will be created, but may make use of any that are created. Immediately after completing the create operation, the agent must set this object to underCreation(3). When in the underCreation(3) state, an entry is allowed to exist in a possibly incomplete, possibly inconsistent state, usually to allow it to be modified in multiple PDUs. When in this state, an entry is not fully active. Entries shall exist in the underCreation(3) state until the management station is finished configuring the entry and sets this object to valid(1) or aborts, setting this object to invalid(4). If the agent determines that an entry has been in the underCreation(3) state for an abnormally long time, it may decide that the management station has crashed. If the agent makes this decision, it may set this object to invalid(4) to reclaim the entry. A prudent agent will understand that the management station may need to wait for human input and will allow for that possibility in its determination of this abnormally long period. An entry in the valid(1) state is fully configured and consistent and fully represents the configuration or operation such a row is intended to represent. For example, it could be a statistical function that is configured and active, or a filter that is available in the list of filters processed by the packet capture process. A manager is restricted to changing the state of an entry in the following ways: To: valid createRequest underCreation invalid From: valid OK NO OK OK createRequest N/A N/A N/A N/A underCreation OK NO OK OK invalid NO NO NO OK nonExistent NO OK NO OK In the table above, it is not applicable to move the state from the createRequest state to any other state because the manager will never find the variable in that state. The nonExistent state is not a value of the enumeration, rather it means that the entryStatus variable does not exist at all. An agent may allow an entryStatus variable to change state in additional ways, so long as the semantics of the states are followed. This allowance is made to ease the implementation of the agent and is made despite the fact that managers should never exercise these additional state transitions."

Each bit of this bit mask corresponds to a sub-identifier of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree, with the most significant bit of the i-th octet of this octet string value (extended if necessary, see below) corresponding to the (8*i - 7)-th sub-identifier, and the least significant bit of the i-th octet of this octet string corresponding to the (8*i)-th sub-identifier, where i is in the range 1 through 16. Each bit of this bit mask specifies whether or not the corresponding sub-identifiers must match when determining if an OBJECT IDENTIFIER is in this family of view subtrees; a '1' indicates that an exact match must occur; a '0' indicates 'wild card', i.e., any sub-identifier value matches. Thus, the OBJECT IDENTIFIER X of an object instance is contained in a family of view subtrees if, for each sub-identifier of the value of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree, either: the i-th bit of vacmViewTreeFamilyMask is 0, or the i-th sub-identifier of X is equal to the i-th sub-identifier of the value of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree. If the value of this bit mask is M bits long and there are more than M sub-identifiers in the corresponding instance of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree, then the bit mask is extended with 1's to be the required length. Note that when the value of this object is the zero-length string, this extension rule results in a mask of all-1's being used (i.e., no 'wild card'), and the family of view subtrees is the one view subtree uniquely identified by the corresponding instance of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree. Note that masks of length greater than zero length do not need to be supported. In this case this object is made read-only. "

This interval can be set to any number of seconds between 1 and 3600 (1 hour). Because the counters in a bucket may overflow at their maximum value with no indication, a prudent manager will take into account the possibility of overflow in any of the associated counters. It is important to consider the minimum time in which any counter could overflow on a particular media type and set the historyControlInterval object to a value less than this interval. This is typically most important for the 'octets' counter in any media-specific table. For example, on an Ethernet network, the etherHistoryOctets counter could overflow in about one hour at the Ethernet's maximum utilization.
