    "description": "The MIB for managing Server Load Balancing Manager(s), such as the Cisco IOS SLB product. This MIB includes instrumentation for the manager-side implementation of the Dynamic Feedback Protocol (DFP). A DFP uses the DFP protocol to communicate with DFP agents in order to obtain information about Servers. This MIB includes the objects required for implementing the load balancer management side of the Server/Application State Protocol (SASP). The load balancer is responsible for registering Members with a SASP-Agent. A Member is an entity that is defined on the load balancer to service Internet traffic. The responsibility of the Agent is to monitor the Members, and report a recommended weight to the load balancer. The weight is then used in load balancing decisions. Acronyms and terms: DFP Dynamic Feedback Protocol SASP Server to Application State Protocol GGSN Gateway GPRS Support Node GPRS General Packet Radio Service GTP GPRS Tunneling Protocol SASP Server/Application State Protocol SGSN Serving GPRS Support Node"
