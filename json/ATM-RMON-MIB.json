Lower priorities indicate a lesser requirement to retain resources than higher priority values. A management station can use the resource priority to provide a probe with additional information for managing memory allocation. A probe is strongly encouraged, but not required, to honor all priority requests, all of the time. Objects declared with this TC should be contained within a conceptual control table entry. The indicated resource priority applies to the control entry, all internal data structures maintained on behalf of the control entry, and all external MIB data represented by the control entry. A probe should honor the priority requests in an implementation-dependent way. The data allocation granularity (i.e., shared data structures) may vary greatly for different implementations, so a particular implementation strategy is not mandated. However, the following guidelines are suggested for those agents which implement garbage-collection based on 'least-recently used' (LRU) or other criteria: In the event that the probe runs short of resources, and data entries are to be removed from particular tables to reclaim resources, then entries associated with lower ResourcePriority values should be deleted before entries associated with higher ResourcePriority values, regardless of the resource reclamation algorithm in use. In addition, entries associated with a higher AddressCollectScope value should be deleted before entries with a lower AddressCollectScope value.
