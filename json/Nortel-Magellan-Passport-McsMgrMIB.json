The value notSet indicates that either the attribute is not supported or that none of the status conditions described below are present. Note that this is a non-standard value, used because the original specification indicated this attribute was set-valued and thus, did not provide a value to indicate that none of the other three are applicable. The value hotStandby indicates that the resource is not providing service but will be immediately able to take over the role of the resource to be backed up, without initialization activity, and containing the same information as the resource to be backed up. The value coldStandby indicates the resource is a backup for another resource but will not be immediately able to take over the role of the backed up resource and will require some initialization activity. The value providingService indicates that this component, as a backup resource, is currently backing up another resource."
