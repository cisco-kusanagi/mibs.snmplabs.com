    "description": "This MIB module defines a set of objects that allow to define a health check procedure on a managed node. The health check procedure is performed through a sequence of simple comparison operations on some managed objects against a control value. The result of the health check is accumulated into a single managed object that can be read by a manager to discover the status of the whole set of managed objects instead of retrieving all the single values controlled during the health check procedure. The main purpose of the CHECK-MIB is increasing scalability of network management applications by moving check operations from the management station to managed nodes. There are five groups of managed objects defined by this MIB module: - objects describing capabilities of the CHECK-MIB implementation; - objects controlling the operational status of the health check procedure; - objects defining the checks in the checkResultTable; - objects defining the operations for each of the configured checks in the checkRuleTable; - objects providing information about failed checks."

The validity of the OID is verified when the manager tries to activate the row, following these actions: - the agent should try to read the value of the object referenced by the OID (like a snmp get operation); if the value is read, the OID refers to a valid instance object and the type of the object should be registered inside the agent; - if the object is not available, then the agent should try to read the next object in the lexicographical order (like a snmp get next operation); if the OID returned is a child node of the checkRuleOid, then the latter is assumed to be a columnar object and the type of the object read is stored inside the agent; - if no object could be found or the OID returned is not a leaf of checkRuleOid, then an inconsistentValue error is return to the attempt of activating the row. When setting the OID of a columnar object, at least one instance object must exist at the moment of the activation of the row, so that the validity test of OID passes and the row is activated. If the OID references an instance object that is removed or become inaccessible after the row has been activated, then rule automatically fails with a severity equal to 4294967295. If the OID value references a columnar object and no instance exists after the first performance, then the rule doesn't fail."

Some operations cannot be applied to all the types of object. If the value of the checkRuleOperation is inconsistent with the type of the object indicated by checkRuleOid, then an attempt to activate the row results in an inconsistentValue error. The value 0 can be configured for all the object types and means that no operation is performed and the rule never fails. When the type of the object indicated by checkRuleOid is IpAddress, BITS, OBJECT IDENTIFIER then only the value equal(2) can be configured. For the IpAddress, the value of the object indicated by checkRuleOid is compared byte by byte with the value of checkRuleValue and the rule doesn't fail if all the bytes are matched. For the OBJECT IDENTIFIER, the rule doesn't fail if checkRuleValue encodes an OID of the same dimension of the value of the object indicated by checkRuleOid and the two OIDs are equal. For the BITS, the rule doesn't fail if the checkRuleValue encodes a bitstring long at least as the number of the named bits and all the named bits are matched with that bitstring. When the type of the object indicated by checkRuleOid is INTEGER, Integer32, Unsigned32, Counter32, Counter64, TimeTicks, Gauge32, all the values from 1 to 6 can be configured. These values define simple mathematical operations: the rule doesn't fail if the the value of the object indicated by checkRuleOid is, respectively, !=, =, <, <=, >, >= than the value of checkRuleValue. A value of of delta(7) can be configured only for Counter32, Counter64, Gauge32; moreover it is permitted only if the check including the rule is performed automatically and thus its value of checkResultInterval greater than 0, otherwise an inconsistentValue error is returned. For a delta operation, each time the rule is performed, the difference between the actual value of the managed object and its value at the last performance is considered and the rule doesn't fail if the difference is <= than the value of the checkRuleValue. If the actual value is less than the previous one, then the difference is augmented with the value 4294967295, like as the managed object reached its maximum value and it has been resetted. Each time the new value of the managed object must be stored by the device in an internal buffer. The buffer must be handled so that when a new managed object is controlled, a new entry is allocated for it. If no more entries are available, then the rule fails with severity 4294967294. If a managed object for which an entry was previously allocated, doesn't exist when a new execution of the delta operation is performed, its entry should be removed. When a new entry is allocated for a new managed object, its value is stored in the entry, but the operation is not computed and the rule doesn't fail; the delta operation is normally computed only from the second time."
