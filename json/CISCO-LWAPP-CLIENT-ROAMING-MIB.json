    "description": "This MIB is intended to be implemented on all those devices operating as Central controllers, that terminate the Light Weight Access Point Protocol tunnel from Cisco Light-weight LWAPP Access Points. Information provided by this MIB is for CCX related features as specified in the CCX specifications. This MIB covers roaming RF parameters for CCX clients. The relationship between CC and the LWAPP APs can be depicted as follows: +......+ +......+ +......+ + + + + + + + CC + + CC + + CC + + + + + + + +......+ +......+ +......+ .. . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . +......+ +......+ +......+ +......+ + + + + + + + + + AP + + AP + + AP + + AP + + + + + + + + + +......+ +......+ +......+ +......+ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . +......+ +......+ +......+ +......+ + + + + + + + + + MN + + MN + + MN + + MN + + + + + + + + + +......+ +......+ +......+ +......+ The LWAPP tunnel exists between the controller and the APs. The MNs communicate with the APs through the protocol defined by the 802.11 standard. LWAPP APs, upon bootup, discover and join one of the controllers and the controller pushes the configuration, that includes the WLAN parameters, to the LWAPP APs. The APs then encapsulate all the 802.11 frames from wireless clients inside LWAPP frames and forward the LWAPP frames to the controller. GLOSSARY Access Point ( AP ) An entity that contains an 802.11 medium access control ( MAC ) and physical layer ( PHY ) interface and provides access to the distribution services via the wireless medium for associated clients. LWAPP APs encapsulate all the 802.11 frames in LWAPP frames and sends them to the controller to which it is logically connected. Basic Service Set ( BSS ) The IEEE 802.11 BSS of an AP comprises of the stations directly associating with the AP. Central Controller ( CC ) The central entity that terminates the LWAPP protocol tunnel from the LWAPP APs. Throughout this MIB, this entity is also referred to as 'controller'. Cisco Compatible eXtensions (CCX) Wireless LAN Access Points (APs) manufactured by Cisco Systems have features and capabilities beyond those in related standards (e.g., IEEE 802.11 suite of standards ,Wi-Fi recommendations by WECA, 802.1X security suite,etc). A number of features provide higher performance.For example, Cisco AP transmits a specific Information Element, which the clients adapt to for enhanced performance. Similarly, a number of features are implemented by means of proprietary Information Elements, which Cisco clients use in specific ways to carry out tasks above and beyond the standard. Other examples of feature categories are roaming and power saving. Client Roaming A client may decide to reassociate with another AP for reasons of its own choosing. The decision of whether or not to use the information contained in the AP list is up to the discretion of the implementor, as long as the roam time requirement is met. Light Weight Access Point Protocol ( LWAPP ) This is a generic protocol that defines the communication between the Access Points and the Central Controller. Mobile Node ( MN ) A roaming 802.11 wireless device in a wireless network associated with an access point. Mobile Node and client are used interchangeably.
