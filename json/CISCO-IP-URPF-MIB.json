    "description": "Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (URPF) is a function that checks the validity of the source address of IP packets received on an interface. This in an attempt to prevent Denial of Service attacks based on IP address spoofing. URPF checks validity of a source address by determining whether the packet would be successfully routed as a destination address. Based on configuration, the check made can be for existence of any route for the address, or more strictly for a route out the interface on which the packet was received by the device. When a violating packet is detected, it can be dropped. This MIB allows detection of spoofingevents."

The per-interface drop rate notification is issued on rates exceeding a limit (rising rate). This dropping may indicate an security attack on the network. To determine whether the attack/event is over, the NMS must consult the managed device. This object can be polled to determine the recent drop rate for the managed device as a whole, in addition to querying particular interface objects. This object is the average rate of dropping over the most recent window of time. The rate is computed by dividing the number of packets dropped over a window by the window time in seconds. The window time is specified by cipUrpfDropRateWindow. Each time the drop rate is computed, and at system startup, a snapshot is taken of the latest value of cipUrpfDrops. Subtracting from this the snapshot of cipUrpfDrops at the start of the current window of time gives the number of packets dropped. The drop rate is computed every cipUrpfComputeInterval seconds. As an example, let cipUrpfDropRateWindow be 300 seconds, and cipUrpfComputeInterval 30 seconds. Every 30 seconds, the drop count five minutes previous is subtracted from the current drop count, and the result is divided by 300 to arrive at the drop rate. At device start-up, until the device has been up more than cipUrpfDropRateWindow, when drop rate is computed, the value of cipUrpfDrops is divided by the time the device has been up. After the device has been up for cipUrpfDropRateWindow, when drop rate is computed, the number of packet drops counted from interval start time to the computation time is divided by cipUrpfDropRateWindow. Changes to cipUrpfDropRateWindow are not reflected in this object until the next computation time.
