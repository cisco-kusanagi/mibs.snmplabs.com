The specific mapping of which values of this object map to which interfaces is out of scope for this document (and in general is set by the vendor). Certain of these classes of interfaces may not exist on specific agents. In which case, setting this object to those values results in related interface bit set being set to an empty bit set. all, allCpe and allNetwork MUST be valid settings for this object on any compliant agent and MUST result in at least one interface bit being set in the related bit set. If both the object with this syntax and its related object are SET in the same action the result is undefined as the order in which the SETs take place is undefined. Either one or the other object should be SET at any given time, not both."

Typical use of these filters is to filter out possibly harmful (given the context of a large metropolitan LAN) protocols. If set to discard(1), any L2 packet which does not match at least one filter in the docsDevFilterLLCTable will be discarded. If set to accept(2), any L2 packet which does not match at least one filter in the docsDevFilterLLCTable will be accepted for further processing (e.g., bridging). In otherwords, if the packet does not match an entry in the table it takes this action, if it does match an entry in the table it takes the opposite of this action. At initial system startup, this object returns accept(2)."

Filter application is ordered by the filter index, rather than by a best match algorithm (Note that this implies that the filter table may have gaps in the index values). Packets which match no filters will have policy 0 in the docsDevFilterPolicyTable applied to them if it exists. Otherwise, Packets which match no filters are discarded or forwarded according to the setting of docsDevFilterIpDefault. Any IP packet can theoretically match multiple rows of this table. When considering a packet, the table is scanned in row index order (e.g. filter 10 is checked before filter 20). If the packet matches that filter (which means that it matches ALL criteria for that row), actions appropriate to docsDevFilterIpControl and docsDevFilterPolicyId are taken. If the packet was discarded processing is complete. If docsDevFilterIpContinue is set to true, the filter comparison continues with the next row in the table looking for additional matches. If the packet matches no filter in the table, the packet is accepted or dropped for further processing based on the setting of docsDevFilterIpDefault. If the packet is accepted, the actions specified by policy group 0 (e.g. the rows in docsDevFilterPolicyTable which have a value of 0 for docsDevFilterPolicyId) are taken if that policy group exists. Logically, this table is consulted twice during the processing of any IP packet - once upon its acceptance from the L2 entity, and once upon its transmission to the L2 entity. In actuality, for cable modems, IP filtering is generally the only IP processing done for transit traffic. This means that inbound and outbound filtering can generally be done at the same time with one pass through the filter table."
