    "description": "A read on this object can return several possible values, depending on the current status of the system and the various file operation objects: idle There is no file operation in progress and all required objects have been set correctly. Setting a '1' to this object will begin the file deletion. Error codes: [1-3] A delete operation cannot be started until these errors are resolved. See below for key. [action]ing x [--> y] A file operation is currently in progress. You cannot start another operation while the object is returning this value. [action] x [--> y] success The last copy, move or delete operation was successfully completed. [action] x [--> y] failure: [err] The last copy, move or delete operation failed, with the error message attached. Common failures include lack of space on the destination file system, incorrect source file names or communication errors with remote services. Upon reading a success or failure message, the message will be cleared and the next read will result in either an 'idle' message or an 'Error codes' message if not all required objects have been correctly set. If a read returns 'idle', a new file operation can be started. File deletion operations ignore the values set in the atFilev2DestinationStackID, atFilev2DestinationDevice and atFilev2DestinationFilename objects. Error codes for file deletion: 1 - atFilev2SourceDevice has not been set 2 - atFilev2SourceFilename has not been set 3 - atFilev2SourceDevice has been set to TFTP Note that if the above requirements are met and the operation would result in a system file being deleted, then an SNMP set to this object will be disallowed. For valid operations, immediately upon executing the SNMP set operation on this object, the file deletion will begin and will continue on the device until either it has completed, or a failure occurs. For large files, operations can take several minutes to complete. Subsequent reads of the object will return one of the messages shown above, to track the progress of the deletion operation."

    "description": "The file system device for which files will be displayed in the FileViewer table. The values supported for this variable are identical to the values for other variables in the MIB, although not all values will actually result in the display of files. The different devices and whether they will result in the display of files are: 1. Flash - Onboard Flash - supported 2. Card - Removable SD card - supported 3. NVS - Onboard battery backed RAM - supported 4. TFTP - not supported 5. USB - Removable USB media - supported Setting this variable to an unsupported value will result in an error, but setting to a value that is supported but on a device that doesn't contain that type of device will not. However, no files will be displayed in the File Viewer table in this case."
