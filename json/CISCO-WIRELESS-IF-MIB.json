    "description": "This is the MIB Module for the Cisco Wireless Radio Point to Point interface specification. I) Relationship of the Cisco Wireless Radio IF MIB to Interfaces MIB: One instance of the ifEntry exists for each wireless interface. The ifType of each such interface will be propWirelessP2P(157). If (at least) one IP address is active on an interface with this ifType without the use of any intervening (multiplexing) sub-layer, then it will appear in exactly two ifStackTable entries: i.e., for an ifType=propWirelessP2P(157) interface with ifIndex 'x', the ifStackTable will contain: ifStackStatus.0.x=active ifStackStatus.x.0=active The ifTestTable and ifRcvAddressTable are not supported by this ifType. II) ifEntry for the Wireless MAC Layer: The ifEntry for the wireless MAC Layer supports the following groups in the Interfaces MIB : a. ifGeneralInformationGroup b. ifHCPacketGroup For all those objects where the behavior is as defined in the Interfaces MIB, refer to Interfaces MIB for description. Special conditions or exceptions are explicitly documented here. IfTable Attribute Comments ================= =============================================== ifType, The IANA value of propWirelessP2P(157). ifMtu, Return 1500. ifSpeed, Current configured bandwidth. It can be 1.5Mbits/sec to 12Mbits/sec. ifPhysAddress, Return 0 length octet string. ifAdminStatus, The administrative status of this interface. ifOperStatus, The current operational status of the wireless MAC layer interface. ifLastChange, Refer to the Interfaces MIB. ifInMulticastPkts, Returns 0. ifInBroadcastPkts, Returns 0. ifOutMulticastPkts, Returns 0. ifOutBroadcastPkts, Returns 0. ifHCInMulticastPkts, Not supported. ifHCInBroadcastPkts, Not supported. ifHCOutMulticastPkts, Not supported. ifHCOutBroadcastPkts, Not supported. Glossary The following terms are used in the MIB definitions below. Radio Interface: The interface that provides the wireless communication features. Radio Link: The bi-directional wireless link that exists between two communicating radio. Radio PHY: Represents the transmission characteristics of the Radio Link. RF Unit: The Radio Frequency components and the associated antennas. ARQ: Automatic Repeat Query. Cisco Wireless MIB Organization The Cisco Wireless Radio IF MIB provides the following management groups : o. Radio Base Group This group contains common information about a radio interface . It provides facilities to configure attributes such as self-test, acquisition mode, etc. It includes configuration information used to set up a radio link. o. Radio PHY Quality Group This group provides facilities to control/tune the transmission and reception quality of the Radio Link. The quality of the Radio Link is measured using the metrics defined in radio Radio Link metrics group. o. Radio Frequency Resource Group This contains information about the Radio frequency transmission and reception resources available on the system. This group determines the portions of the radio spectrum at which the radio subsystem can operate. This group in conjunction with the radio PHY group determine the acutal spectrum that gets used for communications. o. Radio Link Metrics Group This group contains metrics to measure the quality of radio Link. This includes metrics such as total received codeword errors, resync count, errored seconds etc. o. Radio Signal Group This group contains information about the radio signal(s) that were received or attributes of the radio signals computed from received signals. This group models the real-time data that is collected. The key characteristics are: 1. The amount of information captured in these parameters is large and cannot be modeled as single values. 2. They represent real-time information, which cannot be polled for as well. 3. Hardware captures this information. All the radio signal characteristics are modeled in three ways: 1. Histogram 2. Timelines 3. Snapshots For management purposes radio signal characteristics are made accessible via: 1. History Group 2. Timeline Group 3. Snapshot Group These groups are described below. o. History Group This group contains information about the radio system characteristics which are inherently modeled as historgrams. Certain characteristics of the radio system may be captured as histograms by the hardware. The user may configure these histograms as needed. It exists for the following reasons: 1. The amount of information contained in these parameters is large and cannot be modeled as single values. 2. They represent real-time information, which cannot be polled for as well. 3. Key signal processing information cannot be captured by normal SNMP (say 1 sec poll interval) monitoring. 4. Hardware captures this information as histograms. 5. In wireless environments this is key information that can be captured for fault and performance management. o. Timeline Group This group contains information about how raw radio signal characteristics that may be captured. Timelines are normally associated with a threshold defined in the threshold group. o. Threshold Group This provides provides facilities to define thresholds on the raw signal attributes that are processed by the hardware. Normally thresholds are used in conjunction with Timelines to capture specific radio signal behavior. o. Snapshot Group This group provides facilities that may be used to capture multiple radio signal attributes keyed to a single user initiated trigger. Simultaneous capture of multiple real-time attributes keyed to a single trigger provides indepth information about the behavior of the system. o. Test Group This provides facilities to establish loopback at various points in the hardware for diagnostic purposes. o. Antenna Group This group provides information about the antenna resources installed and available for use. o. Trap Group It provides the list of traps that the wireless system will generate."

When an RF resource acts as both a transmit and receive resource, the transmit and receive frequency ranges may overlap. It is indexed by the ifIndex and cwrRfIndex."
