A value of 0 or a value equal to the local slot number will enable local Event Manager processing (events filtering, logging and trap generation). Other values determines the central Event Manager CPU slot number (1 to 16). When central Event Manager is enabled, all the events manager messages are filtered locally and then sent to the CPU card specified by this object for recording. Centralised event manager is avaliable only in CX1000 and CX2000 products. In single CPU units, like the CX900 or the CX950, the value will be fixed to 0 allowing local Event Manager processing only. A log file can be read by the console through UI module. The syntax of the reading command is defined as follows: Command: readlog <logfile> <option> Where: <logfile> - the name of the logfile which contains the events information. <option> - optionnal parameter: 0 to read (default), 1 to read and delete items as they are read, and 2 to delete the enntire file.
