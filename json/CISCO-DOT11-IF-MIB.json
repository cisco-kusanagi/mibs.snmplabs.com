WGB Work-group Bridge WPA WiFi Protected Access GLOSSARY Access point Transmitter/receiver (transceiver) device that commonly connects and transports data between a wireless network and a wired network. Association The service used to establish access point or station mapping and enable STA invocation of the distribution system services. (Wireless clients attempt to connect to access points.) Basic Rate A data rate that is mandatory for client devices to support in order for them to achieve successful association. Basic Service Set The IEEE 802.11 BSS of an AP comprises of the stations directly associating with the AP. Bridge Device that connects two or more segments and reduces traffic by analyzing the destination address, filtering the frame, and forwarding the frame to all connected segments. Bridge AP It is an AP that functions as a transparent bridge between 2 wired LAN segments. Broadcast SSID Clients can send out Broadcast SSID Probe Requests to a nearby AP, and the AP will broadcast its own SSID within its beacons to response to the clients. Clients can use this Broadcast SSID to associate and communicate with the AP. Cyclic Redundancy Check CRC is an error detect mechanism that applies to frame transmission. Direct-Sequence Spread Spectrum DSSS combines a data signal at the sending station with a higher data rate bit sequence, which many refer to as a chipping code (also known as processing gain). A high processing gain increases the signals resistance to interference. DSSS sends a specific string of bits for each data bit sent. ERP-CCK Modulation This signal modulation technique is supported in PHY implementing IEEE 802.11b/g Protocol. ERP-OFDM Modulation This signal modulation technique is supported in PHY implementing IEEE 802.11g Protocol. Extensible Authentication Protocol EAP acts as the interface between a wireless client and an authentication server, such as a RADIUS server, to which the access point communicates over the wired network. Extended Rate PHY This PHY implements the IEEE 802.11g Protocol. Frequency-Hopping Spread Spectrum In FHSS, a hopping code determines the frequencies the radio will transmit and in which order. To properly receive the signal, the receiver must be set to same hopping code and listen to the incoming signal at the right time and correct frequency. The code pattern maintains a single logical channel. IEEE 802.11 Standard to encourage interoperability among wireless networking equipment. IEEE 802.11b High-rate wireless LAN standard for wireless data transfer at up to 11 Mbps. IEEE P802.11g Higher Speed Physical Layer (PHY) Extension to IEEE 802.11b, will boost wireless LAN speed to 54 Mbps by using OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing). The IEEE 802.11g specification is backward compatible with the widely deployed IEEE 802.11b standard. Inter-Access-Point Protocol The IEEE 802.11 standard does not define how access points track moving users or how to negotiate a handoff from one access point to the next, a process referred to as roaming. IAPP is a Cisco proprietary protocol to support roaming. However, IAPP does not address how the wireless system tracks users moving from one subnet to another. Independent network Network that provides peer-to-peer connectivity without relying on a complete network infrastructure. Integrity Check Value The WEP ICV shall be a 32-bit value containing the 32-bit cyclic redundancy code designed for verifying wireless data frame integrity. Message Integrity Check A MIC can, optionally, be added to WEP-encrypted 802.11 frames. MIC prevents attacks on encrypted packets. MIC, implemented on both the access point and all associated client devices, adds a few bytes to each packet to make the packets tamper-proof. Native VLAN ID A switch port and/or AP can be configured with a 'native VLAN ID'. Untagged or priority-tagged frames are implicitly associated with the native VLAN ID. The default native VLAN ID is '1' if VLAN tagging is enabled. The native VLAN ID is '0' or 'no VLAN ID' if VLAN tagging is not enabled. Node Device on a network; has its own unique network address and name. Non-Root Bridge This wireless bridge does not connect to the main wired LAN segment. It connects to a remote wired LAN segment and can associate with root bridges and other non-root bridges that accept client associations. It also can accept associations from other non-root bridges, repeater access points, and client devices. Physical Layer Convergence Procedure In IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs, PLCP defines a method of mapping the IEEE 802.11 MAC sublayer protocol data units into a framing format suitable for sending and receiving user data and management information between two or more wireless stations using the associated PMD system. Physical Medium Dependent In IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs, a PMD system, whose function defines the characteristics of, and method of transmitting and receiving data through, a wireless medium between two or more wireless stations each using the DSSS. Preamble The radio preamble are data at the head of a packet that contains information access points and client devices required by IEEE 802.11 when sending and receiving packets. Primary LAN In an AP, if the destinations of inbound unicast frames are unknown, the frames are sent toward the primary LAN defined on the device. Radio carrier Radio waves that deliver energy to a remote receiver; in other words, radio waves in a wireless LAN environment. Repeater Device that connects multiple segments, listening to each and regenerating the signal on one to every other connected one; so that the signal can travel further. Repeater or Non-root Access Point The repeater access point is not connected to the wired LAN. The Repeater is a wireless LAN transceiver that transfers data between a client and another access point, another repeater, or between two bridges. The repeater is placed within radio range of an access point connected to the wired LAN, another repeater, or an non-root bridge to extend the range of the infrastructure. Radio Frequency Radio wave and modulation process or operation. Root Access Point This access point connects clients to the main wired LAN. Root (Wireless) Bridge This wireless bridge connects to the main wired LAN. It can communicate with non-root wireless bridges, repeater access points, and client devices but not with another wireless root bridge. Only one wireless bridge in a wireless LAN can be set as the wireless root bridge. Spread-spectrum Wideband radio frequency technique that consumes more bandwidth than the narrow-band alternative but produces a signal that is louder and easier to detect. There are two types of spread-spectrum radio: frequency hopping and direct sequence. Radio Service Set ID SSID is a unique identifier that APs and clients use to identify with each other. SSID is a simple means of access control and is not for security. The SSID can be any alphanumeric entry up to 32 characters. Tag header A 'tag header' is as defined in the IEEE 802.1Q standard. An 802.1Q tag header contains a 3-bit priority field and a 12-bit VLAN ID field. A 'priority tag' has a VLAN ID of 0, to indicate 'no VLAN ID'. A 'VLAN tag' has a non-zero VLAN ID. Virtual LAN VLAN defined in the IEEE 802.1Q VLAN standard supports logically segmenting of LAN infrastructure into different subnets or workgroups so that packets are switched only between ports within the same VLAN. VLAN ID Each VLAN is identified by a 12-bit 'VLAN ID'. A VLAN ID of '0' is used to indicate 'no VLAN ID'. Valid VLAN IDs range from '1' to '4095'. VLAN of ID '4095' is the default VLAN for Cisco VoIP Phones. Wired Equivalent Privacy WEP is generally used to refer to 802.11 encryption. Work-group Bridge It is a client to APs or wireless root bridges. The radio port of a WGB serves as the uplink to the main network and the Ethernet port provides network access for devices like PC or IP phone. Upgrade of Frequencies As per the latest regulations proposed by the Japanese Government, the four channels 34 ( 5170 GHz ), 38 ( 5190 GHz), 42 ( 5210 ) and 44 ( 5230 ) in the 5150-5250 MHz band has been shifted by 10 MHz. Thus, the new channels in the 5150-5250 MHz band are 36 ( 5180 ), 40 ( 5200 ) and 44 ( 5220 ) and 48 ( 5240 )."
