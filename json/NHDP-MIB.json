Due to the nature of NHDP, the local router may not know if two distinct addresses belong to the same interface of a neighbor or to two different interfaces. As the local router gains more knowledge of its neighbors, its local view may change, and this table will be updated to reflect the local router's current understanding, associating address sets to neighbor interfaces. The local router identifies a virtual neighbor interface through the receipt of address lists advertised through an NHDP HELLO message. All objects of type NeighborIfIndex are assigned by the agent out of a common number space. The value for each discovered virtual neighbor interface may not remain constant from one re-initialization of the entity's network management agent to the next re-initialization. If the local router gains information associating two virtual interfaces on a neighbor as a common interface, then the agent MUST aggregate the two address sets to a single index chosen from the set of aggregated indexes, and it MUST update all tables in this MIB module that are indexed by indexes of type NeighborIfIndex. It MAY then reuse freed index values following the next agent restart. The specific value is meaningful only within a given SNMP entity."

Due to the nature of NHDP, the local router may identify multiple virtual neighbors that, in fact, are one and the same. Neighbors that are two hops away with more than one advertised address will exhibit this behavior. As the local router's knowledge of its neighbors' topology increases, the local router will be able to associate multiple virtual neighbor indexes into a single virtual neighbor index chosen from the set of aggregated indexes; it MUST update all tables in this MIB module indexed by these indexes, and it MAY reuse the freed indexes following the next agent re-initialization. All objects of type NeighborRouterIndex are assigned by the agent out of a common number space. The NeighborRouterIndex defines a discovered NHDP peer virtual neighbor of the local router.

The interface is identified by the ifIndex from the interfaces group defined in the Interfaces Group MIB module. A conceptual row in this table exists if and only if either a manager has explicitly created the row or there is an interface on the managed device that supports and runs NHDP. The manager can create a row by setting rowStatus to 'createAndGo' or 'createAndWait'. Row objects having associated DEFVAL clauses are automatically defined by the agent with these values during row creation, unless the manager explicitly defines these object values during the row creation. If the corresponding entry with ifIndex value is deleted from the Interface Table, then the entry in this table is automatically deleted, NHDP is disabled on this interface, and all configuration and state information related to this interface is to be removed from memory."

In NHDP, it is not necessary to remove Protocol Tuples from Protocol Sets at the exact time indicated, only to behave as if the Protocol Tuples were removed at that time. This case is indicated here as 'down(0)', all other cases being indicated as 'asymmetric(1)' or 'symmetric(2)'. If 'down(0)', the direct neighbor is also added to the nhdpNibLostNeighborSetTable."
