    "description": "The PerceivedSeverity defines six severity levels, which provide an indication of how it is perceived that the capability of the managed object has been affected. Those severity levels which represent service affecting conditions ordered from most severe to least severe are critical, major, minor and warning. The levels used are as defined in X.733, ITU Alarm Reporting Function: o The Indeterminate severity level indicates that the severity level cannot be determined. o The Critical severity level indicates that a service affecting condition has occurred and an immediate corrective action is required. Such a severity can be reported, for example, when a managed object becomes totally out of service and its capability must be restored. o The Major severity level indicates that a service affecting condition has developed and an urgent corrective action is required. Such a severity can be reported, for example, when there is a severe degradation in the capability of the managed object and its full capability must be restored. o The Minor severity level indicates the existence of a non-service affecting fault condition and that corrective action should be taken in order to prevent a more serious (for example, service affecting) fault. Such a severity can be reported, for example, when the detected alarm condition is not currently degrading the capacity of the managed object. o The Warning severity level indicates the detection of a potential or impending service affecting fault, before any significant effects have been felt. Action should be taken to further diagnose (if necessary) and correct the problem in order to prevent it from becoming a more serious service affecting fault. o The Cleared severity level indicates the clearing of one or more previously reported alarms. This alarm clears all alarms for this managed object that have the same Alarm type, Probable cause and Specific problems (if given). When an alarm is cleared, an alarmCleared event is generated. This event clears the alarm with the AlarmActiveFaultId contained in the event. It is not required that the clearing of previously reported alarms are reported. Therefore, a managing system cannot assume that the absence of an alarmedCleared event for a fault means that the condition that caused the generation of previous alarms is still present. Managed object definers shall state if, and under which conditions, the alarmedCleared event is used. The clear value of AlarmSeverity is an action which is used when a management station wants to clear an active alarm. This is not possible on all systems, and thus an agent does not have support write access for this value."

This label is set by the initiator to provide for the following possibilities: o A management station may recognize resources it owns and no longer needs. o A network operator can find the management station that owns the resource and negotiate for it to be freed. o A network operator may decide to unilaterally free resources another network operator has reserved. o Upon initialization, a management station may recognize resources it had reserved in the past. With this information it may free the resources if it no longer needs them. Management stations and agent systems should support any format of the OwnerString dictated by the local policy of the organization. It is suggested that this name contain one or more of the following: IP address, management station name, network manager's name, location, or phone number. This information will help users to share the resources more effectively. There is often default functionality that the device or the administrator of the agent (often the network administrator) wishes to set up. The resources associated with this functionality are then owned by the device itself or by the network administrator, and are intended to be long-lived. In this case, the device or the administrator will set the relevant owner object to a string starting with 'local'. Indiscriminate modification of the local configuration by network management stations is discouraged. In fact, a network management station should only modify these objects under the direction of the administrator of the agent system."
