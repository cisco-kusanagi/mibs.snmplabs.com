    "description": "Denotes a transport domain and address, much like the TDomain and TAddress textual convention pair defined in RFC 1902, yet in a more compact representation. The first octet identifies the transport domain. This value directly corresponds to the value of the transport domain object sub-identifier, as defined in RFC1906, that is subordinate to iso.org.dod.internet.snmpV2.snmpDomains. The remaining octets conform to the transport address syntax associated with the specified transport domain. For example, a value of 1 in the first octet corresponds to snmpUDPDomain, so the remaining octets conform to the syntax of snmpUDPAddress. For convienence, the mappings are summarized as follows. Note that UDP/IP and IPX are fixed length; CLNS, CONS and DDP are variable length.
