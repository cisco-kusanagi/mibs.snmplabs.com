Filter application is ordered by the filter index, rather than by a best match algorithm (note that this implies that the filter table may have gaps in the index values). Packets that match no filters will have policy 0 in the docsDevFilterPolicyTable applied to them, if it exists. Otherwise, Packets that match no filters are discarded or forwarded according to the setting of docsDevFilterIpDefault. Any IP packet can theoretically match multiple rows of this table. When considering a packet, the table is scanned in row index order (e.g., filter 10 is checked before filter 20). If the packet matches that filter (which means that it matches ALL criteria for that row), actions appropriate to docsDevFilterIpControl and docsDevFilterPolicyId are taken. If the packet was discarded processing is complete. If docsDevFilterIpContinue is set to true, the filter comparison continues with the next row in the table, looking for additional matches. If the packet matches no filter in the table, the packet is accepted or dropped for further processing according to the setting of docsDevFilterIpDefault. If the packet is accepted, the actions specified by policy group 0 (e.g., the rows in docsDevFilterPolicyTable that have a value of 0 for docsDevFilterPolicyId) are taken, if that policy group exists. Logically, this table is consulted twice during the processing of any IP packet: once upon its acceptance from the L2 entity, and once upon its transmission to the L2 entity. In actuality, for cable modems, IP filtering is generally the only IP processing done for transit traffic. This means that inbound and outbound filtering can generally be done at the same time with one pass through the filter table. The objects in this table are only accessible from cable devices that are not operating in DiffServ MIB mode (RFC 3289). See the conformance section for details. Note that some devices are required by other specifications (e.g., the DOCSIS OSSIv1.1 specification) to support the legacy SNMPv1/v2c docsDevFilter mode for backward compatibility. Table entries MUST NOT persist across reboots for any device. This table is deprecated. Instead, use the DiffServ MIB from RFC 3289."
