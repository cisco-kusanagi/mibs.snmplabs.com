The switching mode of a port determines whether or not it learns station location information from source addresses of packets received on the port; the switching mode also determines whether or not packets with unknown destination addresses received on other ports are flooded out this port. The following notation is used in the switching mode definitions that follow: LRN: station location information is learned from source addresses of packets received on port. !LRN: station location information is NOT learned from source addresses of packets received on port. FUD: packets with unknown destination addresses received on other ports are flooded out this port. !FUD: packets with unknown destination addresses received on other ports are NOT flooded out this port. A port may be configured to operate in one of the following switching modes: standard(1): LRN & FUD This is the mode in which all ports of a 802.1D-compliant standard switch operates. workgroup(2): LRN & !FUD This is the mode in which workgroup side ports of a workgroup switch operates. backbone(3): !LRN & FUD This is the mode in which the backbone port of a workgroup switch operates. manual(4): !LRN & !FUD In this mode, forwarding out this port is fully determined by management-specified filters. When learning is disabled on a port (i.e., mode is changed to backbone(3) or manual(4)), whether addresses previously learned on the port are purged immediately or allowed to age out naturally is implementation dependent. Note that all ports may be configured to operate in the manual(4) switching mode with a single operation, viz. by enabling(2) the manual mode switch defined by the following object: eSwitchAddrFdbManualMode."

If auto-interval(2) is specified, normal operation is automatically resumed on the offending port after a time interval specified by the MIB object eSwitchStormAutoInterval. If rate-limit(3) is specified, the storm control action continues for the next p polling intervals, where p is the number of polling intervals that the control has to remain in effect in order to ensure that the long term average of the regulated traffic is less than the user specified rate limit. For example, if the user-specified rate limit is 500 packets/polling interval, and 5000 multicast packets were received during the last polling interval, the storm control action continues to be in effect for the next 9 polling intervals. This ensures that no more than 5000 multicast packets are forwarded out of the offending port in 10 polling intervals. Thus the long term multicast traffic average is maintained at 500 packets/polling interval. The responsive-rate-limit(4) resumption policy is identical to the rate-limit(3) policy, except for the following difference. Once storm control action has been initiated, if the switch determines that the storm has subsided (for example, less than 500 packets were received during the last polling interval), normal operation is immediately resumed, instead of waiting for 'p' polling intervals to complete."
