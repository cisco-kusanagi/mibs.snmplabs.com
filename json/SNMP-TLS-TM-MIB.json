Values of this textual convention may not be directly usable as transport-layer addressing information, and may require run-time resolution. As such, applications that write them must be prepared for handling errors if such values are not supported, or cannot be resolved (if resolution occurs at the time of the management operation). The DESCRIPTION clause of TransportAddress objects that may have SnmpTLSAddress values must fully describe how (and when) such names are to be resolved to IP addresses and vice versa. This textual convention SHOULD NOT be used directly in object definitions since it restricts addresses to a specific format. However, if it is used, it MAY be used either on its own or in conjunction with TransportAddressType or TransportDomain as a pair. When this textual convention is used as a syntax of an index object, there may be issues with the limit of 128 sub-identifiers specified in SMIv2 (STD 58). It is RECOMMENDED that all MIB documents using this textual convention make explicit any limitations on index component lengths that management software must observe. This may be done either by including SIZE constraints on the index components or by specifying applicable constraints in the conceptual row DESCRIPTION clause or in the surrounding documentation.",

On an incoming (D)TLS/SNMP connection, the client's presented certificate must either be validated based on an established trust anchor, or it must directly match a fingerprint in this table. This table does not provide any mechanisms for configuring the trust anchors; the transfer of any needed trusted certificates for path validation is expected to occur through an out-of-band transfer. Once the certificate has been found acceptable (either by path validation or directly matching a fingerprint in this table), this table is consulted to determine the appropriate tmSecurityName to identify with the remote connection. This is done by considering each active row from this table in prioritized order according to its snmpTlstmCertToTSNID value. Each row's snmpTlstmCertToTSNFingerprint value determines whether the row is a match for the incoming connection: 1) If the row's snmpTlstmCertToTSNFingerprint value identifies the presented certificate, then consider the row as a successful match. 2) If the row's snmpTlstmCertToTSNFingerprint value identifies a locally held copy of a trusted CA certificate and that CA certificate was used to validate the path to the presented certificate, then consider the row as a successful match. Once a matching row has been found, the snmpTlstmCertToTSNMapType value can be used to determine how the tmSecurityName to associate with the session should be determined. See the snmpTlstmCertToTSNMapType column's DESCRIPTION for details on determining the tmSecurityName value. If it is impossible to determine a tmSecurityName from the row's data combined with the data presented in the certificate, then additional rows MUST be searched looking for another potential match. If a resulting tmSecurityName mapped from a given row is not compatible with the needed requirements of a tmSecurityName (e.g., VACM imposes a 32-octet-maximum length and the certificate derived securityName could be longer), then it must be considered an invalid match and additional rows MUST be searched looking for another potential match. If no matching and valid row can be found, the connection MUST be closed and SNMP messages MUST NOT be accepted over it. Missing values of snmpTlstmCertToTSNID are acceptable and implementations should continue to the next highest numbered row. It is recommended that administrators skip index values to leave room for the insertion of future rows (for example, use values of 10 and 20 when creating initial rows). Users are encouraged to make use of certificates with subjectAltName fields that can be used as tmSecurityNames so that a single root CA certificate can allow all child certificate's subjectAltName to map directly to a tmSecurityName via a 1:1 transformation. However, this table is flexible to allow for situations where existing deployed certificate infrastructures do not provide adequate subjectAltName values for use as tmSecurityNames. Certificates may also be mapped to tmSecurityNames using the CommonName portion of the Subject field. However, the usage of the CommonName field is deprecated and thus this usage is NOT RECOMMENDED. Direct mapping from each individual certificate fingerprint to a tmSecurityName is also possible but requires one entry in the table per tmSecurityName and requires more management operations to completely configure a device."

It extends the SNMP-TARGET-MIB's snmpTargetAddrTable so that the client can verify that the correct server has been reached. This verification can use either a certificate fingerprint, or an identity authenticated via certification path validation. If there is an active row in this table corresponding to the entry in the SNMP-TARGET-MIB that was used to establish the connection, and the row's snmpTlstmAddrServerFingerprint column has non-empty value, then the server's presented certificate is compared with the snmpTlstmAddrServerFingerprint value (and the snmpTlstmAddrServerIdentity column is ignored). If the fingerprint matches, the verification has succeeded. If the fingerprint does not match, then the connection MUST be closed. If the server's presented certificate has passed certification path validation [RFC5280] to a configured trust anchor, and an active row exists with a zero-length snmpTlstmAddrServerFingerprint value, then the snmpTlstmAddrServerIdentity column contains the expected host name. This expected host name is then compared against the server's certificate as follows: - Implementations MUST support matching the expected host name against a dNSName in the subjectAltName extension field and MAY support checking the name against the CommonName portion of the subject distinguished name. - The '*' (ASCII 0x2a) wildcard character is allowed in the dNSName of the subjectAltName extension (and in common name, if used to store the host name), but only as the left-most (least significant) DNS label in that value. This wildcard matches any left-most DNS label in the server name. That is, the subject *.example.com matches the server names a.example.com and b.example.com, but does not match example.com or a.b.example.com. Implementations MUST support wildcards in certificates as specified above, but MAY provide a configuration option to disable them. - If the locally configured name is an internationalized domain name, conforming implementations MUST convert it to the ASCII Compatible Encoding (ACE) format for performing comparisons, as specified in Section 7 of [RFC5280]. If the expected host name fails these conditions then the connection MUST be closed. If there is no row in this table corresponding to the entry in the SNMP-TARGET-MIB and the server can be authorized by another, implementation-dependent means, then the connection MAY still proceed."
