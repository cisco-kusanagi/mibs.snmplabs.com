For system that are connected via wire-less communications it is useful to limit the bandwidth requirements of SNMP access, particularly for table accesses that can be bandwidth intensive.

The default value for this variable is 'logMaxSize'. When 'logViewPageSize' is set at any value smaller than 'logMaxSize', the 'logRecTable' may have multiple pages, depending upon how many log records are present in the log ('logCurrentSize'), and the viewing filter 'logViewSeverityFilter'. The variable 'logViewPageControl' allows the SNMP user to retrieve any of these pages. For example, if 'logMaxSize' and 'logCurrentSize' is 50, and 'logViewPageSize' is 5, then there could be effectively 10 logical pages (depending upon view filters).

    "description": "This non-persistent variable allows a user to control the present page view of the 'logRecTable'. When 'logViewPageSize' is set at any value smaller than 'logMaxSize', the 'logRecTable' may have multiple pages, depending upon how many log records are present in the log ('logCurrentSize'), and the viewing filter 'logViewSeverityFilter'. This variable 'logViewPageControl' allows the SNMP user to retrieve any of these pages. For the purpose of clarity in the description below, lets assume 'logCurrentSize' is 47, and 'logViewPageSize' is 10. With this example, there would be 5 viewable pages, identified as pages 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Pages 1 through 4 have 10 log records each, while page 5 has only 7 records. Setting this variable to 1 causes the first view page to be retrieved when 'logRecTable' is next read by the SNMP user. That is records 1 through 10 would be retrieved. Setting this variable to 2 causes the records 11 through 20 to be retrieved. Setting 'logViewPageControl' to 3 causes 21 through 30; 4 causes 31 through 40; and 5 causes 41 through 47 to be retrieved the next time 'logRecTable' is read. The viewing of a different page becomes a two step operation; first this variable 'logViewPageControl' is set with a value then the 'logRecTable' is read. The default value is 1. Allowable values are 1 through the value which represents the last page at any specific point in time that this variable is written. If the input value is larger than the value representing the last page, then the input is ignored (no error returned), and 'logViewPageControl' is set to the last page given the current system log and viewing filter criteria ('logViewFilter'). A input value of 0 is accepted (without error) to represent the first page. Thus a 1 is written. If at any time the current view of the system log has changed (because of the dynamic nature of the system log), such that 'logViewPageControl' is too large, then this variable will be automatically set to a new value that represents the last page. Thus the only time a 'logRecTable' is retrieve empty, is because there are no records matching the view filter criteria, not because 'logViewPageControl' indicates an invalid page. 'logViewEvents' indicates the number of system events that would be displayable on all pages of the 'logRecTable' given the view filtering criteria specified by the current value of 'logViewSeverityFilter'. Examining 'logViewEvents' may assist in choosing how a user may want to change this variable 'logViewPageControl'. The retrieval of the 'logRecTable' is also effected by the view sorting variables 'logViewMethod', 'logViewDirection', and 'logViewAge' which provide sorting criteria. (These determine the order of the the records.) Also note, that the system log is a dynamic history of events. Records may be deleted automatically because of replacement rules (new events overwriting older events), or through human interaction via SNMP, or possible a platform's console or configuration port interface. With such a situation, a user may retrieve the next or previous page, and see some or all of the same log events that where presented earlier. Similarly, the user may completely overlook a record that shifts from a logical position on a particular page during one retrieval and has moved to a different page when the next retrieval occurs. This variable is automatically given the value of 1 whenever any of the other viewing variables are modified ('logViewPageSize', and these identified below). The retrieval of the 'logRecTable' is effected by the other viewing variables, which provide sorting and filtering controls. These other variables are: 'logViewSeverityFilter', 'logViewMethod', 'logViewDirection', 'logViewAge'."

'critical' is the highest severity level, followed in decreasing order by 'major', 'minor', 'warning', and 'normal', which is the lowest severity level. These severity levels can be further qualified with an indication that the 'health' of the system is effected because of this event. In such a case, these events are indicated with the '-health' suffix ( 'critical-health', 'major-health', 'minor-health', 'warning-health', 'normal-health'). Additionally, a health effecting event can be normalized by an associated event. For example, on the Network Management Unit, or NMU, the radio PPP link going down is normalized by the radio PPP going up, and vice versa. When a health effecting event is subsequently normalized (and have no further subsequent occurance), then the log record indicates this qualification with the '-NORMALIZED' suffix as below: 'normal-NORMALIZED', 'warning-NORMALIZED', 'minor-NORMALIZED', 'major-NORMALIZED', 'critical-NORMALIZED'. 'other' indicates a class of log record, rather than a severity level. The severity level of 'other' is considered less important than 'normal'. 'other' primarily is used to indicate a 'Debug' type of log record. Some log events have configurable severity levels. Others have predetermined (non-configurable) severity levels.

'unLimited' allows the Agent to send any and all traps, without any controls to limit the flow. (Other filters may cause traps not to be sent.) 'unLimited' is the default value. 'feedbackPinLimited' causes the Agent to limit the number of traps that can be sent in a specified time period. If the Agent needs to send more traps than allowed, then it sends a final Trap (nmu.trap.nmTrapsDisabled) indicating that the limit has been reached. The Agent then disables its ability to send traps. This method is described in RFC 1224. Setting this MIB to 'feedbackPinLimited' automatically causes the variable 'trapFlow' to be forced to 'open'. For details see the MIB descriptions for the two other controlling variables 'trapWindowPeriod' and 'trapMaxPerWindow'. The Agent determines if a trap can be sent by examining several controls (or filters), all of which enable the sending of the trap. These are described in their order of checking below: One, the MIB variable that enables that specific trap to be sent is enabled. (Each trap can be selectively enabled or disabled.) If a trap is not sent due to this filter, then 'trapFilteredSpecific' is incremented. Two, the MIB 'trapControl', is set to 'unLimited'; or, it is set to 'feedbackPinLimited' and 'trapFlow' is set to 'open'.

    "description": "This persistent variable indicates the time period in minutes that is used by the feedback/pin trap limiting algorithm as specified in RFC 1224. The smallest value allowed for 'trapWindowPeriod' is 1 and the largest value allowed is 1440 which specifies a period of 24 hours. The default value is 15. This variable only takes affect when 'trapControl' is set to 'feedbackPinLimited'. This method operates as described below: If 'trapMaxPerWindow' traps occur and are sent by the Agent in the time period specified by the 'trapWindowPeriod' and another trap needs to be sent, then the Agent ignores this over the limit trap, and forces itself into a mode where it will send no more traps. The Agent sends the 'trapsDisabled' Trap, prior to entering this mode. The Agent then sets the 'trapFlow' control variable to 'closed' which allows no more traps to be sent until this variable is set to 'open', by an SNMP set operation. The agent sends the 'trapsDisabled' Trap, so that an SNMP manager will have an indication that it has sent an excessive number of traps. The agent sets the 'trapFlow' variable to 'closed', so that a Manager can poll this variable periodically, and determine that this Agent has sent too many traps. A Network Administrator can then perform more selective MIB inquiries to determine a more complete status of theis unit. When this limiting condition occurs, the Agent also logs a system event with a severity of 'MAJOR', marking the event as effecting the health of the system. This impact on the health of the NMU is canceled when either 'trapFlow' is set back to 'open', or 'trapControl' is changed to any value other than 'feedbackPinLimited'. If 'trapWindowPeriod' is modified during an active timing period of this feedback method, then the Agent performs in this manner. 1) If the valid new value is larger than the previous value for 'trapWindowPeriod', then the new value is used for any trap timing in the future, and the previous trap history is expanded to the new period size. 2) If the valid new value is smaller than the previous value for 'trapWindowPeriod', then the current trap history is shorten (by reducing the older entries), and the new value is used for any trap timing in the future. A simple example: The Agent can be configured to allow one trap per minute by setting 'trapWindowPeriod' to 1, and 'trapMaxPerWindow' to 1. With this configuration, if at any time a trap needs to be sent within 1 minute of a previous trap, the Agent would limit itself. This implementation of the Feedback Pin technique uses a timing quantum that is one minute as determined by the system's clock. The timing quantum is synchronized to a particular second determined by the first trap of a new window period. All traps within 60 seconds of this starting second accumulate to represent traps sent within that quantum-minute. Traps continue to be counted, and assigned to a new quantum-minute depending upon the starting second, and an aggregate counter represents the total number of traps within the current period. As the full period of history accumulates, traps associated with a quantum-minute at the front of the period reduce the aggregate total as the current clock moves into a new quantum-minute. Thus this window period is a moving period related to the current clock. A new synchronizing second is not choosen unless there is a full 'trapWindowPeriod' that has no traps sent. With this situation, a new starting second is chosen when the new trap needs to be sent. The NMU's system clock resolution is not extremely accurate, but provides reasonable accuracy for limiting traps with this technique."

These are reduced, until the aggregate trap count exactly equals the new value for 'trapMaxPerWindow', which is used subsequently for determining the trap limit. In this way, the 'trapsDisabled' will not be sent until the new limited is exceeded.

'enabled' allows the SNMP Agent to attempt to send the linkUp trap, provided the other checks describe below do not prohibit this trap from transmission. 'disabled' disallows the SNMP Agent from attempting to send the linkUp trap, thus 'filtering' this trap from transmission'. In this case, 'trapFilteredSpecific' will be incremented. This MIB variable is the first of four checks that the NMU Agent uses to filter traps, based upon 1) a specific enable or disable control variable; 2) 'trapControl' which offers a gross on/off/limit control; 3) 'trapMgrTable' with 'trapMgrControl' and 'trapMgrAddress' which filters whether standard traps (such as this linkUp) and/or enterprise traps are sent to each specific trap manager; and 4) 'trapSeverityFilter' which filters traps according to a controlling severity level (In the case of linkUp, there is no associated severity level, so this final filter does not apply). Whenever any of these trap filters cause a trap to be filtered, the corresponding MIB statistic is incremented. These statistics are 'trapFilteredSpecific', 'trapFilteredControl', 'trapFilteredManager', and 'trapFilteredSeverity' . See the MIB descriptions for any of these above variables for details."

    "description": "This trap is sent when the SNMP Agent has generated and sent 'trapMaxPerWindow' traps in the time period specified by 'trapWindowPeriod', and another traps is attempted to be sent. The Agent limits itself by sending the 'trapsDisabled' Trap, and setting the 'trapFlow' control variable to 'closed'. This trap will only be sent when 'trapControl' is set to 'feedbackPinLimited', and the 'trapFlow' control variable has a value of 'open'. This trap is the 'alertsDisabled' trap used by the feedback/pin trap limiting algorithm as specified in RFC 1224. For details see the MIB descriptions for the two other controlling variables 'trapWindowPeriod' and 'trapMaxPerWindow'. The variables included in the trap are: trapSequenceNumber; trapLastTimestamp; trapWindowPeriod; trapMaxPerWindow."
