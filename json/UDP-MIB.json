This table includes support for connected UDP endpoints and support for identification of the operating system process associated with a UDP endpoint. - Deprecated the udpGroup and replaced it with object groups representing the current set of objects. - Deprecated udpMIBCompliance and replaced it with udpMIBCompliance2, which includes the compliance information for the new object groups.

    "description": "A table containing information about this entity's UDP endpoints on which a local application is currently accepting or sending datagrams. The address type in this table represents the address type used for the communication, irrespective of the higher-layer abstraction. For example, an application using IPv6 'sockets' to communicate via IPv4 between ::ffff:10.0.0.1 and ::ffff:10.0.0.2 would use InetAddressType ipv4(1). Unlike the udpTable in RFC 2013, this table also allows the representation of an application that completely specifies both local and remote addresses and ports. A listening application is represented in three possible ways: 1) An application that is willing to accept both IPv4 and IPv6 datagrams is represented by a udpEndpointLocalAddressType of unknown(0) and a udpEndpointLocalAddress of ''h (a zero-length octet-string). 2) An application that is willing to accept only IPv4 or only IPv6 datagrams is represented by a udpEndpointLocalAddressType of the appropriate address type and a udpEndpointLocalAddress of '0.0.0.0' or '::' respectively. 3) An application that is listening for datagrams only for a specific IP address but from any remote system is represented by a udpEndpointLocalAddressType of the appropriate address type, with udpEndpointLocalAddress specifying the local address. In all cases where the remote is a wildcard, the udpEndpointRemoteAddressType is unknown(0), the udpEndpointRemoteAddress is ''h (a zero-length octet-string), and the udpEndpointRemotePort is 0. If the operating system is demultiplexing UDP packets by remote address and port, or if the application has 'connected' the socket specifying a default remote address and port, the udpEndpointRemote* values should be used to reflect this."
