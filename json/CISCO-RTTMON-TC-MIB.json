The value 'echo' will cause the RTT application to perform a timed echo request/response operation directed at the 'RttMonTargetAddress'. The value 'pathEcho' will cause the RTT application to perform path discovery to the 'RttMonTargetAddress', then it will perform a timed echo request/response operation directed at the each hop along the path. This operation will provide two types of information, first the path and second the time delay along the path. NOTE: The 'pathEcho' time delay operation is a heuristic measurement because an intermediate hop may forward the different echo request/response at different rates. Thus the time delay difference between two hops along a path may contain very little 'true' statistical meaning. The value 'fileIO' will cause the RTT application to write, read, or write/read a file to a preconfigured file server. The value 'script' will cause the RTT application to execute a preconfigured script. The value 'udpEcho' will cause the RTT application to perform a timed udp packet send/receive operation directed at the 'RttMonTargetAddress'. The value 'tcpConnect' will cause the RTT application to perform a timed tcp connect operation directed at the 'RttMonTargetAddress'. The value 'http' will cause the RTT application to perform a download of the object specified in the URL. The value 'dns' will cause the RTT application to perform a name lookup of an IP Address or a hostname. The value 'jitter' will cause the RTT application to perform delay variance analysis. The value 'dlsw' will cause the RTT application to perform a keepalive operation to measure the response time of a DLSw peer. The value 'dhcp' will cause the RTT application to perform an IP Address lease request/teardown operation. The value 'voip' will cause the RTT application to perform call set up operation to measure the response. The value 'rtp' will cause the RTT application to perform delay variance analysis for RTP packet. The value 'lspGroup' will cause the RTT application to logically group Label Switched Paths discovered as part of LSP Path Discovery to the target and perform an RTT operation end to end over each path in the Group. The type of operation configured is determined by rttMplsVpnMonCtrlRttType. The value 'icmpjitter' will cause the RTT application to perform delay variance analysis using ICMP timestamp packets. The value of 'lspPingIpv4' will cause the RTT application to perform ping over LSP path. The value of 'lspTraceIpv4' will cause the RTT application to perform trace over LSP path. The value of 'ethernetPing' will cause the RTT application to perform delay variance analysis using regular 802.1ag loopback frame. The value of 'ethernetJitter' will cause the RTT application to perform delay variance analysis using CFM frame. The value of 'lspPingPseudowire' will cause the RTT application to perform LSP Ping over Pseudowire and measure response time. The value 'video' will cause the the RTT application to perform a video stream analysis directed at the 'RttMonTargetAddress The value 'y1731Delay' will cause the RTT application to perform a ITU-T standard Y.1731 delay variance analysis The value 'y1731Loss' will cause the RTT application to perform a ITU-T standard Y.1731 loss measure analysis The value 'mcastJitter' will cause the RTT application to perform udp jitter stream analysis on a multicast network. The value 'fabricPathEcho' will cause the RTT application to perform delay performance measurment and verify connectivity in a Fabric Path Network."

SNA addresses will be provided in ASCII, but will be converted to EBCDIC It is interpreted as follows, for the specified values of RttMonProtocol: ipIcmpEcho, ipUdpEchoAppl, ipTcpConn, jitterAppl, dlswAppl, dnsAppl, httpAppl, and dhcpAppl - 4 octets snaRUEcho - N octets, containing the value of the sna HOSTNAME of which the SSCP LU will be used for the operation. For many systems this value can be empty, and the system will use the implied SSCP LU. For example 'NSPECHO'. snaLU0EchoAppl and snaLU2EchoAppl - N octets, the first x octets are the HOSTNAME (Alternatively, this could be a PU name defined to transport to the desired HOST), the second y octets are the APPLID, and the last z octets are the MODENAME of the Echo Server (blank for a MODENAME default). The address will be encoded with a size byte preceding each of the x y and z called s. For example sxsysz as in '0x06CWBC060x07NSPECHO0x00' where HOSTNAME = CWBC06, APPLID = NSPECHO, and MODENAME is defaulted to 8 blanks. NOTE: MODENAME is either size 0 or 8. snaLU62Echo and snaLU62EchoAppl - N octets, the first x octets are the LU-NAME, the second y octets are the TP-NAME, and the last z octets are the MODENAME of the Echo Server. The address will be encoded with a size byte preceding each of the x y and z called s. For example sxsysz (zero size before z for a MODENAME default). The LU-NAME is composed of 8 bytes '.' 8 bytes.
