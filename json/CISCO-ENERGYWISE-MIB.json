    "description": "The MIB is used to manage and optimize power usage in networks. Cisco EnergyWise is a specification of data, discovery and protocols for managing power on and between network devices. An entity is Cisco EnergyWise compatible, if it complies with Cisco EnergyWise specification. A Cisco EnergyWise entity is characterized by the power related attributes of a physical entity present in ENTITY-MIB. Cisco EnergyWise solves the problem of Network Power Management. One of goals of Cisco EnergyWise is to manage power on network level. Some solutions in FCAPS have focused on managing a single element but Cisco EnergyWise provides the capability to handle the management of a network of devices, as well as a single device. Concepts and Definitions: ========================= Cisco EnergyWise Entity: A physical entity that is part of the network that provides power or draws power from another part of the network. Cisco EnergyWise Level: A uniform way to classify power settings on an EnergyWise entity. Levels are guidelines for the manufacturers of entity (e.g., shut, hibernate, sleep, standby). Cisco EnergyWise Usage: The consumption of power by a Cisco EnergyWise entity in watts. Current The current power consumption by an Cisco EnergyWise entity. Provisioned The maximum power a Cisco EnergyWise entity can draw in the current level. Usage Vector A vector 0..10 representing the maximum power a Cisco EnergyWise entity can draw at each level. Delta Vector This defines a vector 0..10 representing the difference between the Current and Usage Vector for each level. Cisco EnergyWise Entity Power Unit: This is used to represent smaller or larger quantities of Cisco EnergyWise usage and conforms to the standard prefixes for the SI (System International) units of measure. The value represents an exponent of 10. For example, if current usage of an EnergyWise entity is 3, it could be 3 W, 3 mW, 3 KW, 3 MW depending on the value of Cisco EnergyWise power unit, i.e. 0, -3, 3, or 6 respectively. Cisco EnergyWise Domain: A collection of entities that is divided into manageable sets. Switch, IP phones, IP cameras, lighting controllers can be Cisco EnergyWise entities, all part of a domain. A domain can contain multiple devices. Cisco EnergyWise Entity Importance: The importance attribute of an entity enables the management station to differentiate other Cisco EnergyWise entities in the domain with a different business context. This also provides a choice to the administrators to manage power in context of importance. For example, assuming we have 2 phones deployed in a enterprise. One phone is in a shared spare office and one used by trader generating lot of money as part of core business of enterprise. This clearly demonstrates that the phone used by trader is more important than the phone used in the spare office. Nanny Vector: A vector of bits, representing different features (E.g., sleep, wakeup, shutdown) supported on a Cisco EnergyWise entity. Setting of some of the features on the Cisco EnergyWise entity can be managed by itself, but for some others, a parent has to nanny. Nanny: An EnergyWise entity acts on behalf of another another Cisco EnergyWise entity. Cisco EnergyWise Parent: A Cisco EnergyWise entity that does not have a nanny vector. This entity can manage all its power setting for itself as well as for Cisco EnergyWise entities contained in it. The contained in relationship is same as defined in ENTITY-MIB. Cisco EnergyWise Child: A Cisco EnergyWise entity that has a nanny vector. It requires a Cisco EnergyWise parent to serve as nanny. Depending on the nanny vector a Cisco EnergyWise child can be fully or partially managed. Cisco EnergyWise Neighbor: A Cisco EnergyWise entity to which Cisco EnergyWise protocol events can be forwarded to. An entity can either discover a neighbor using a discovery protocol, or the neighbor can be configured as a static neighbor by the Management station. A Cisco EnergyWise parent may also nanny a Cisco EnergyWise neighbor. For example, A Cisco EnergyWise compatible entity like an IP phone, connected to a port on the switch, can provide a nanny vector to the switch to serve as a nanny. Cisco EnergyWise Proxy: A device attached to a port that does not understand the Cisco EnergyWise protocol, but has the provision to manage power through network APIs or a proprietary protocol. A Proxy is always configured on a port. It allows the Cisco EnergyWise protocol to be used with other non networking devices that draw power indirectly. For example, a Lutron controller (building lighting controller) is a nonnetworking device which does not understand Cisco EnergyWise protocol. However, it runs a proprietary BACNET protocol. The following diagram represents the relationship between cewEntTable and cewNeighborTable, cewEntTable and cewProxyTable. Points to a --------------------- nbr entry for --------------------- | EntPhyIdx | NbrId | which it does | NbrId | Name | --------------------- Nanny --------------------- | 101 | 1 |----------------->| 1 | IP-Phone1 | --------------------- --------------------- | 102 | 0 | | 2 | Switch1 | --------------------- --------------------- | 103 | 3 |----------------->| 3 | IP-Phone2 | --------------------- --------------------- | 104 | 0 |---------- | | | --------------------- | --------------------- | 105 | 0 |----- | | | | --------------------- | | --------------------- | | Points to proxy | | ----------------------------- entry configured | | | EntPhyIdx | PrxyId | Name | on this port. | | ----------------------------- | |-->| 104 | 1 | LC1 | | ----------------------------- | | | | | | ----------------------------- -------> | 105 | 3 | BL2 | ----------------------------- | | | | ----------------------------- Cisco EnergyWise Event: It is a policy that can be either configured on a Cisco EnergyWise entity or received from other Cisco EnergyWise entities. Using this, a Cisco EnergyWise entity can adjust its power settings according to some criteria, typically time. For example, a Management station can configure an EnergyWise event on a switch to control devices in branch offices, to go to power level standby at 8pm and power level full at 7am. Cisco Energywise Query: It is a Cisco Energywise CLI used to get power information from the entire Energywise Domain. Queries are delivered, hop by hop, through the Domain using the established neighbor information. Authentication is by the domain's shared secret, and only authenticated queries can be sent to EndPoints. EnergyWise supports various kinds of queries, including set, collect, sum and delta. set: changes or turns off power usage levels collect: retrieves power usage information (in watts) from the cloud. sum: aggregates power information across multiple Members and Endpoints. delta: runs what if calculations. Cisco EnergyWise Neighbor Id : The Cisco EnergyWise Neighbor's unique Id is made up of two parts:- UDI: Unique Device Indentification of the Cisco EnergyWise Neighbor. EntPhysicalIndex: The Entity Physical Index of the Cisco EnergyWise Neighbor. A combination of these two values provide a unique Id for the Cisco EnergyWise Neighbor."
