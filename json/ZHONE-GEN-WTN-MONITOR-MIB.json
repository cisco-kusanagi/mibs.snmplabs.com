When operational, the LED is turned on when diagnostics are performed or when the system detects an alarm. operational - Upon power up the LED is off. When the system is operating it is turned on. The actual LED is blinked when the ZMS link is down or during software download. lineInterface - This LED is turned on when there are no wire-line alarms. For SkyZhone45 - this refers to the DS3 line. For SkyZhone155 - this refers to the fiber. For SkyZhone8e - this refers to the set of T1/E1 lines. radio - This LED is turned on when there are no radio receive alarms. local- This LED is turned on when there are not alarms present on the Near End indoor or outdoor units. remote - This LED is turned on when there are not alarms present on the Far End indoor or outdoor units."
