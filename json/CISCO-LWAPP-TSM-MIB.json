    "description": "This MIB is intended to be implemented on all those devices operating as Central controllers, that terminate the Light Weight Access Point Protocol tunnel from Cisco Light-weight LWAPP Access Points. Network management stations learn the audio/video traffic quality observed on WLANs through this MIB. The relationship between CC and the LWAPP APs can be depicted as follows: +......+ +......+ +......+ + + + + + + + CC + + CC + + CC + + + + + + + +......+ +......+ +......+ .. . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . +......+ +......+ +......+ +......+ + + + + + + + + + AP + + AP + + AP + + AP + + + + + + + + + +......+ +......+ +......+ +......+ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . +......+ +......+ +......+ +......+ + + + + + + + + + MN + + MN + + MN + + MN + + + + + + + + + +......+ +......+ +......+ +......+ The LWAPP tunnel exists between the controller and the APs. The MNs communicate with the APs through the protocol defined by the 802.11 standard. LWAPP APs, upon bootup, discover and join one of the controllers and the controller pushes the configuration, that includes the WLAN parameters, to the LWAPP APs. The APs then encapsulate all the 802.11 frames from wireless clients inside LWAPP frames and forward the LWAPP frames to the controller. This MIB provides the information about the per-client /per-AP packet latency, packet jitter, packet loss and roaming time in the network which does affect quality of audio/video traffic. These parameters are called Traffic Stream Metrics. When TSM collection is enabled on all 802.11a/802.11b interfaces, the metrics are collected by controller from AP in every 90 seconds window. Information provided by this MIB can be used by the NMS applications to present measurements of audio and video traffic quality. GLOSSARY Access Point ( AP ) An entity that contains an 802.11 medium access control ( MAC ) and physical layer ( PHY ) interface and provides access to the distribution services via the wireless medium for associated clients. LWAPP APs encapsulate all the 802.11 frames in LWAPP frames and sends it to the controller to which it is logically connected. Central Controller ( CC ) The central entity that terminates the LWAPP protocol tunnel from the LWAPP APs. Throughout this MIB, this entity is also referred to as 'controller'. Light Weight Access Point Protocol ( LWAPP ) This is a generic protocol that defines the communication between the Access Points and the Central Controller. Mobile Node ( MN ) A roaming 802.11 wireless device in a wireless network associated with an access point. Traffic Stream Metrics (TSM) These are parameters like the per-client / per-AP packet latency, packet jitter, packet loss and roaming time in the network, which does affect quality of audio/video traffic. These statistics are collected to study and characterize the pattern of data traffic and perform appropriate management tasks to regulate the same for the smooth functioning of the network. Channel Utilization (CU) The Channel Utilization is defined as the percentage of time, the QAP sensed the medium was busy, as indicated by either the physical or virtual carrier sense (CS) mechanism. Picc Picc is the time consumed by AP for receiving frames not destined to itself on a particular Radio interface from co-channel APs and Clients. Pib Pib is the time consumed by AP for receiving frames on a particular Radio interface which are not correctly de-modulated.

For example, suppose a client with address 12:3f:73:99:de:5b connects to the 802.11 radio interface, 13:13:43:de:bb:ff of an AP at 18:30:00 hours. Assuming that cLTsmDot11aConfig (or cLTsmDot11bConfig) is set to 'true' for the respective type of interface, every 90 seconds, AP sends the controller statistical data for the client 12:3f:73:99:de:5b associated at the interface 13:13:43:de:bb:ff. So, after 3 minutes, i.e., 180 seconds, controller would have received statistics for the particular client and AP combination twice leading to two rows in this table as follows. 1> Client: 12:3f:73:99:de:5b Interface:13:13:43:de:bb:ff Time: 18:33:00 2> Client: 12:3f:73:99:de:5b Interface:13:13:43:de:bb:ff Time: 18:31:30 Now assume that, at 18:33:00, the client moves and associates with another AP associated to the same controller, at the AP's 802.11 interface 14:14:43:de:dd:ee. After 3 minutes, i.e., 180 seconds (say), controller would have again received statistics from the AP, for the particular client and new AP combination twice leading to two new rows in this table. At this point, this table will have entries with following references : 1> Client: 12:3f:73:99:de:5b Interface:14:14:43:de:dd:ee Time: 18:36:00 2> Client: 12:3f:73:99:de:5b Interface:14:14:43:de:dd:ee Time: 18:34:30 3> Client: 12:3f:73:99:de:5b Interface:13:13:43:de:bb:ff Time: 18:33:00 4> Client: 12:3f:73:99:de:5b Interface:13:13:43:de:bb:ff Time: 18:31:30 The maximum number of entries in this table is indicated by cLTsmDot11MaxTsmStatsEntries. When the specified limit of entries is reached the oldest entries will be removed to make room for new entries. However, the controller may remove the entries if it encounters memory shortage."

    "description": "This table represents the statistics received by the controller from the associated APs, on the downlink traffic ( traffic from the AP to the 802.11 wireless client ) observed on the dot11 interfaces of the respective APs. For example, suppose a client with address 12:3f:73:99:de:5b connects to the 802.11 radio interface, 13:13:43:de:bb:ff of an AP at 18:30:00 hours. Assuming that cLTsmDot11aConfig (or cLTsmDot11bConfig) is set to 'true' for the respective type of interface, every 90 seconds, the AP sends the controller statistical data about the 12:3f:73:99:de:5b associated at the interface 13:13:43:de:bb:ff. So, after 3 minutes, i.e., 180 seconds, controller would have received statistics from the AP for the particular client and AP combination twice leading to two rows in this table as follows. 1> Client: 12:3f:73:99:de:5b Interface:13:13:43:de:bb:ff Time: 18:33:00 2> Client: 12:3f:73:99:de:5b Interface:13:13:43:de:bb:ff Time: 18:31:30 Now assume that, at 18:33:00, the client moves and associates with another AP associated to the same controller, at the AP's 802.11 interface 14:14:43:de:dd:ee. After 3 minutes, i.e., 180 seconds (say), controller would have again collected statistics for the particular client and new AP combination twice leading to two new rows in this table. At this point, this table will have entries as follows. 1> Client: 12:3f:73:99:de:5b Interface:14:14:43:de:dd:ee Time: 18:36:00 2> Client: 12:3f:73:99:de:5b Interface:14:14:43:de:dd:ee Time: 18:34:30 3> Client: 12:3f:73:99:de:5b Interface:13:13:43:de:bb:ff Time: 18:33:00 4> Client: 12:3f:73:99:de:5b Interface:13:13:43:de:bb:ff Time: 18:31:30 The maximum number of entries in this table is indicated by cLTsmDot11MaxTsmStatsEntries. When the specified limit of entries is reached the oldest entries will be removed to make room for new entries. However, the controller may remove the entries if it encounters memory shortage."
