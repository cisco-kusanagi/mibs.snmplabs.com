For example, consider the case where a manager wants to set the transmission mode to allow ADSL2Plus modes. The instrumentation code, in the case of a read-modify-write cycle, could result in receiving a row where the adslLineTransAtucConf is is set one way while the pdnAdslLineTransAtucConfig is set another way.

    "description": "This MIB module is a supplement to the ADSL-LINE-MIB and to the ADSL-LINE-EXT-MIB, the `standard` MIBs, where additional objects are needed to support ADSL modes or flavors not covered in the `standard` MIBs. At the time this MIB was defined, the IETF ADSL MIB Working does not have any work on the 'standard' MIBs planned and/or has not produced a schedule to address ADSL2/ADSL2plus needs. As a result, these objects may be a `temporary' solution until MIBs/Objects are defined or extended to meet the needs of ADSL2/ADSL2plus. The following documents that should be referenced with respect to this MIB: [G.997.1] ITU-T G997.1 `Physical layer management for Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) transceivers', May 2003.

The objects pdnAdslLineTransAtucCap, pdnAdslLineTrans- AtucConfig, and pdnAdslLineTransAtucActual exist along with their PdnAdslTransmissionModeType TC because the AdslTransmissionModeType defined in the ADSL-LINE-EXT-MIB does not include the ADSL2/ADSL2plus bits defined in ITU G.997.1 (05/2003) ATU Transmission System Enabling (ATSE) section. When using the objects defined in this MIB with a syntax of type PdnAdslTransmissionModeType, the interworking relationship between these objects and the objects defined in the ADSL-LINE- EXT-MIB defined with a syntax of type AdslTransmissionModeType must be considered and explained in an implementation-specific document such as an Operational Specification. Note that the PdnAdslTransmissionModeType is a super set of the AdslTransmis- sionModeType. One possible implementation could be as follows: 1. Both objects of syntax AdslTransmissionModeType defined in the ADSL-LINE-EXT-MIB and objects of syntax PdnAdsl- TransmissionModeType defined in this MIB are supported. By supporting both, a manager with the ADSL-LINE-EXT-MIB loaded could manage the device with the restriction of not being able to utilize ADSL2/ADSL2plus modes. 2. When the ADSL2/ADSL2plus capabilities are desired, a manager would have to use the objects defined in this MIB to configure the transmission modes, read capability, or read the actual transmission mode of the ATU-C. 3. The transmission mode that the ATU-C is currently configured for is based on the last object, adslLineTrans- AtucConfig or pdnAdslLineTransAtucConfig, that was written."

Only while the line power management state is the L3 state, the line can be forced into the loop diagnostics mode procedures. The following are ways to force the line to the L3 state: (1) Set the ifAdminStatus to down. When the loop diagnostics mode procedures are completed successfully, this object shall reset to ldsf0 and the line shall return to and remain in the L3 idle state. The loop diagnostics data shall be available at least until the line is forced to the L0 state.
