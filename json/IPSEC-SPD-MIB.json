An octet string represents a start date and time and an end date and time. For example: yyyymmddThhmmss/yyyymmddThhmmss Where: yyyy = year mm = month dd = day hh = hour mm = minute ss = second The first 'yyyymmddThhmmss' sub-string indicates the start date and time. The second 'yyyymmddThhmmss' sub-string indicates the end date and time. The character 'T' within these sub-strings indicates the beginning of the time portion of each sub-string. The solidus character '/' separates the start from the end date and time. The end date and time MUST be subsequent to the start date and time. There are also two allowed substitutes for a 'yyyymmddThhmmss' sub-string: one for the start date and time, and one for the end date and time. If the start date and time are replaced with the string 'THISANDPRIOR', this sub-string would indicate the current date and time and the previous dates and time. If the end date and time are replaced with the string 'THISANDFUTURE', this sub-string would indicate the current date and time and the subsequent dates and time. Any of the following SHOULD be considered a 'wrongValue' error: - Setting a value with the end date and time earlier than or equal to the start date and time. - Setting the start date and time to 'THISANDFUTURE'. - Setting the end date and time to 'THISANDPRIOR'.",
