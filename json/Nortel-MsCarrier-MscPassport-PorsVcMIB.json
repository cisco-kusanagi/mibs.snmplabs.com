Since RouteSelector does not verify manual routes the value of 4 for routeBumpingPriority symbolizes an unknown value for manual routes. The remainder of the description is not applicable to manual routes. The bumping priority of a route specifies a priority at which a path along that route can be established. The lowest bumping priority is 4, the highest bumping priority is equal to a setup priority contained in the route request data. If a route is selected at bumping priority 4, then no paths will be bumped since there appears to be enough free bandwidth on selected trunks, and also since this bumping priority is not better than the lowest holding priority (4) of any path. If a route cannot be selected at bumping priority 4 and a setup priority is 3 or better, then a route may be selected at bumping priority 3. This means that paths at holding priority 4 may be bumped if currently there is not enough free bandwidth on selected trunks to establish the new path with setup priority 3. If a route cannot be selected at bumping priority 3 and a setup priority is 2 or better, then a route may be selected at bumping priority 2. In this case paths with holding priority 4 and 3 may be bumped if there is not enough free bandwidth on selected trunks to establish the new path with setup priority 2.

This attribute always has a value of allAttributesMet for manual routes since RouteSelector does not verify manual routes. This attribute has a meaningful value if reasonForNoRoute attribute has a value of attributesNotMet. The value of attributeNotMet is only computed when RouteSelector operates in manual mode. That is, when route selection has been initiated by the operator in which case operationMode has a value of manual. RouteSelector determines which of the attributes: requiredRxBandwidth, requiredTxBandwidth, requiredTrunkModes, maximumAcceptableCost, maximumAcceptableDelay, maximumAcceptableGatewaCost, requiredTrafficType, permittedTrunkTypes, requiredSecurity, requiredCustomerParameter, and maximumTransmissionUnit prevents successful route selection by dropping the constraints associated with that attribute and reselecting the route. If that route can be successfully selected then the attribute for which the constraints were dropped is the attribute preventing successful route selection. For example, RouteSelector drops bandwidth constraints by selecting a route with requiredRxBandwidth or requiredTxBandwidth of 0. If the route can be selected then bandwidth is preventing successful route selection. A value of unknownAttributeNotMet indicates that RouteSelector cannot determine why route cannot be selected. Constraints for all attributes are dropped yet successful route cannot be computed. This usually indicates a lack physical connectivity to the destination or gateway node. Alternatively, this may indicate that destination or gateway node is more than 20 hops away where 20 hops is the maximum number of hops in the route."

RouteSelector then selects a route or gets a manual route and returns its description in the selected route description data in the selected route message back to the PORS VC. In the manual mode, the RouteSelector allows the operator to modify the parameters in the route request data (except for the manual path profile reference), and to initiate route selection using that data. When RouteSelector selects the route it displays its description to the operator. Note that even when operationMode is set to manual, RouteSelector handles route request messages originated by services' VCs in the same way as it does when operationMode is set to automatic."

For cost based algorithm, RouteSelector selects gateway node that advertised it can reach the destination at the smallest cost. For random algorithm, RouteSelector selects randomly any gateway node that advertised it can reach the destination. For legacy algorithm, RouteSelector selects a complete route to the destination without attempting to route through gateway nodes. This is only possible during single to multi topology region migration, or cluster migration but before such migration is complete. During such migrations routing to the destination is initially attempted through gateway nodes, but if such routing fails then legacy routing is attempted."

If a trunk in the route attribute was previously locked, or has a Trk PA subcomponent that is not in the up state , that Trunk is considered as having no available bandwidth. If the Trunk PA is in mapped mode, the inability to allocate an Atmif Vcc also results in this failure reason. insufficientRxLcOrBandwidth - At present there is either no available bandwidth or logical channel numbers available on one or more of the Trunks for this path in the receive direction. If a trunk in the route attribute was previously locked, or has a Trk PA subcomponent that is not in the up state , that Trunk is considered as having no available bandwidth. trunkFailure- A Trunk on the path has failed or has gone down, due to a provisioning change of a critical attribute, as the path was being established. trunkCardFailure- A Trunk FP card has failed along the path as the path was being established. accessCardFailure- The FP on which the peer access service was running has failed as the path was being established. operatorForced- The path has terminated due to the operator locking a Trunk along the path as the path was being established. lostLcnClash- The path has terminated because the Trk PA's at both ends of an intermediate trunk have allocated the same Trk LC to different calls. When this happens both calls must go down and then try to come up again a fraction of a second later (effectively ensuring that they will now be assigned different Trk LC's). It is normal to get the odd clash especially when the Trk PA usedLC is approaching the Trk PA maxLC. An LCN clash results in the path failing to instantiate only if the application disabled rerouting. By default rerouting is enabled for all applications. Applications can disable rerouting by using a Rtg Pors Prof/n component with pathFailureAction set to disconnectConnection. networkCongestion - The path has failed to establish due to control information being lost and not being recoverable. trunkNotFound - Check for Trunks not up or names provisioned incorrectly in route attribute . farEndNotFound - The far end is not provisioned or is not up. The called NSAP address cannot be reached through the last node in the Rtg Pors ManualPath path. farEndBusy - The far end has been reached but it is busy. Check remote end provisioning. unknownReason - The failure was not resolved. farEndNotReady - The remote end was reached but the connection was refused due to the remote end not being enabled. serviceTypeMismatch - The remote service type does not match this service type. Check provisioning. bumped - Another call bumped this path, as it was being established, from a trunk to get bandwidth (or an LC) which it required to come up. This other path had a higher setupPriority than this path's holdingPriority hence it was allowed to steal the bandwidth (or LC) from this path. A manual path that is bumped fails to instantiate if it cannot bump another path along the same route, or if it has pathFailureAction set to disconnectConnection. trunkOrFarEndDidNotSupportMode - This call was unable to complete because a mode required by the service was not supported by one of the Trunks the route went through or by the far end service it connected to. Currently the only mode that this applies to is the map/mux mode on Trk Pa Atm component."

If any trunk in the sequence does not meet the requirements (bandwidth, permittedTrunkType, security, customerParm, etc.) for a component listed in users, path validation fails and no path is instantiated for that user. Changing this attribute will cause active connections of users of this ManualPath to move to the new route only if the users have optimization enabled and Rtg Pors optimizationInterval > 0. Otherwise, changing this attribute will cause the users' current connections to stay on the old route with all new calls instantiating their paths with the new route. Optimization can be disabled by having the application use a Rtg Pors Prof/n component with optimization disabled or by setting Rtg Pors optimizationInterval 0. As an example, the trunk component name for the trunk instance 10 on node MoonBase is EM/MoonBase Trk/10. These strings are case insensitive but the complete component name must be input. Note 1: the trunk designation must be in the 3-letter form 'trk'. Note 2: only the outbound trunk component names are used to provision the route."
