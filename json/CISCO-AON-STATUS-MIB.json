    "description": "This MIB module defines managed objects that facilitate the management of AON node. The information available through this MIB includes o AON node state i.e., whether the AON node is 'unregistered', 'registered', 'active', 'inactive'. o Node metrics information when a node is in the 'active' state. o The node metrics information includes the number of messages received by the node, number of PEPs deployed and number of messages received by a PEP as well as information about the end points that the messages are delivered to. The metrics are reset when the AON data plane is restarted. The following terms are used throughout this MIB: AON : Application Oriented Networking. _____________ | AON | | Management | | Console | |____________| | | | | ____ |____________________________ | | AON Node | | __V_________ _________ | | | | | | | | | AON | | AON | | | | Management|---->| Data | | | | Agent | | Plane | | | |___________ |________| | | | |_________________________________| Figure 1 : AON AON data plane: This is the piece of software that runs on the AON node and is responsible for processing application message traffic. AMC : AON Management Console. A Web-based application used to manage the AON installation, upgrade, and operation. This is also referred to as the AON Management Plane. AMA : AON Management Agent. An agent that runs on the AON node and acts as intermediary between the AON data plane and the AMC. AON Node : An AON node is either a single device (blade or appliance) or a virtual cluster of devices (blades or appliances) that are running the AON software. AON Cloud : A group of AON nodes that are connected together via NextHop configuration is referred to as an AON cloud. _____________ _____________ | Source | | Destination | | End point | | End point | | Application | | Application | | ____________| |_____________| _____|________________________________^_____ ( | AON Cloud | ) ( __V______ ________ ____|___ ) ( | | | | | | ) ( | AON | | AON | | AON | ) ( | Entry | | Inter- | | Exit | ) ( | Node | | mediate| | Node | ) ( | |---->| Node |---->| | ) ( | | | | | | ) ( | | | | | | ) ( |_______ | |_______ | |________| ) ( ) ( ) (___________________________________________ ) Figure 2: AON Cloud Entry Node : The first node in an AON cloud, generally the one closest to the client, is known as the Entry Node. This node is also sometimes referred to as the Client Proxy. Exit Node : The ultimate node in an AON cloud, generally the one closest to the server, is known as the Exit Node. This node is also sometimes referred to as the Server Proxy. Intermediate Node : Any AON node in an AON cloud that is neither directly communicating with the client or the server (i.e. neither an Entry Node nor an Exit Node) is known as an Intermediate Node. PEP : Policy Execution Plan. A PEP is a sequence of bladelets that determine how a message is processed in AON. MEP : Message Exchange Pattern. MEP describes the pattern of messages required by a communications protocol to establish or use a communication channel. There are two major message exchange patterns: a request response pattern, and a one way pattern. Bladelet : A bladelet is a piece of software that performs a specific message handling function. Bladelets are combined together into PEPs. Send Bladelet : Routing bladelet that sends a message to a selected destination. Notify Bladelet : Bladelet for generating a custom notification (either as SNMP trap or email) based on user specified condition. NamedException : A NamedException is exposed by a bladelet as connection points to identify a recoverable exception. The action to handle a NamedException thrown by a bladelet can be explicitly designed in the PEP by associating a execution path which comprises of a series of bladelet. Exception Block : It is the block in the PEP that is marked by the exception marker and which is executed in case of a bladelet exception that is not a NamedException that has an output path associated with it. URI : Uniform Resource Identifier. A URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) is the way you identify any content in the Internet space, whether it be a page of text, a video or sound clip, a still or animated image, or a program. The most common form of URI is the Web page address, which is a particular form or subset of URI called a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). A URI typically describes: * mechanism used to access the resource * specific computer that the resource is housed in * specific name of the resource (a file name) on the computer. URL : Uniform Resource Locator. A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the unique Internet address for a file. The URL contains the name of the protocol to be used to access the file resource, a domain name that identifies a specific computer on the Internet, and a pathname, a hierarchical description that specifies the location of a file in that computer. End point: An end point is an application that is either a sender (client) or a receiver (server) of messages that communicates with AON."
