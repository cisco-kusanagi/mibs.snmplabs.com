The CUCM had not yet obtained the requested information. The device will automatically attempt to register again. If this alarm occurs again, manually reset the device. If this alarm continues to occur after the manual reset, there may be an internal firmware error. This is applicable for SCCP protocol only. invalidCapabilities: The CUCM detected an error in the media capabilities reported in the StationCapabilitiesRes message by the device during registration. The device will automatically attempt to register again. If this alarm occurs again, manually reset the device. If this alarm continues to occur after the manual reset, there may be a protocol error. This is applicable for SCCP protocol only. capabilityResponseTimeout: The CUCM timed out while waiting for the device to respond to a request to report its media capabilities. Possible causes include device power outage, network power outage, network configuration error, network delay, packet drops, and packet corruption. It is also possible to get this error if the CUCM node is experiencing high CPU usage. Verify that the device is powered up and operating. Verify that network connectivity exists between the device and CUCM, and verify that the CPU utilization is in the safe range. This is applicable for SCCP protocol only. securityMismatch: The CUCM detected a mismatch in the security settings of the device and/or the CUCM. The mismatches that can be detected are: 1) The device established a secure connection, yet reported that it does not have the ability to do authenticated signaling. 2) The device did not establish a secure connection, but the security mode configured for the device indicates that it should have done so. 3) The device established a secure connection, but the security mode configured for the device indicates that it should not have done so autoRegisterDBError: Auto-registration of a device failed for one of the following reasons: 1)Auto-registration is not allowed for the device type. 2)An error occurred while adding the auto-registering device to the database (stored procedure). dbAccessError: Device registration failed because of an error that occurred while building the station registration profile. This usually indicates a synchronization problem with the database. autoRegisterDBConfigTimeout: The CUCM timed out during auto-registration of a device. The registration profile of the device did not get inserted into the database in time. The device will automatically attempt to register again. This is applicable for SCCP protocol only. deviceTypeMismatch: The device type reported by the device does not match the device type configured on the CUCM addressingModeMismatch: The CUCM detected an error related to the addressing mode configured for the device. One of the following errors were detected: 1)The device is configured to use only IPv4 addressing, but did not specify an IPv4 address. 2)The device is configured to use only IPv6 addressing, but did not specify an IPv6 address. This is applicable for SCCP protocol only."

The scope of this enumeration can expand to comply with RFC 2578. noError: No Error unknown: Unknown error cause noEntryInDatabase: Device not configured properly in the CUCM database databaseConfigurationError: Device configuration error in the CUCM database deviceNameUnresolveable: The CallManager is unable to resolve the device name to an IP Address internally maxDevRegExceeded: Maximum number of device registrations have been reached connectivityError: CallManager is unable to establish communication with the device during registration initializationError: Indicates an error occurred when the CallManager tries to initialize the device deviceInitiatedReset: Indicates that the error was due to device initiated reset callManagerReset: Indicates that the error was due to call manager reset. deviceUnregistered: DeviceUnregistered. malformedRegisterMsg: Indicates that SIP device attempted to register with CallManager, but the REGISTER message contained formatting errors. sccpDeviceThrottling: The indicated SCCP device exceeded the maximum number of events allowed per-SCCP device. keepAliveTimeout: A KeepAlive message was not received. Possible causes include device power outage, network power outage, network configuration error, network delay,packet drops, packet corruption and CUCM node experiencing high CPU usage. configurationMismatch: The configuration on the SIP device does not match the configuration in CUCM. callManagerRestart: A device restart was initiated from CUCM Administration, either due to an explicit command from an administrator or due to a configuration change such as adding, deleting or changing a directory number associated with the device. duplicateRegistration: CUCM detected that the device attempted to register to two nodes at the same time. CUCM initiated a restart to the phone to force it to re-home to a single node. callManagerApplyConfig: CUCM configuration is changed. deviceNoResponse: Device is not responding Service Control Notify from CUCM. emLoginLogout: The device has been unregistered due to an Extension Mobility login or logout. emccLoginLogout: The device has been unregistered due to an Extension Mobility Cross Cluster login or logout. powerSavePlus: The device powered off as a result of the Power Save Plus feature that is enabled for this device. When the device powers off, it remains unregistered from CUCM until the Phone On Time defined in the Product Specific Configuration for this device. callManagerForcedRestart: The device did not respond to an Apply Config request and as a result, CUCM had sent a restart request to the device. The device may be offline due to a power outage or network problem. Confirm that the device is powered-up and that network connectivity exists between the device and CUCM. This is applicable for SIP protocol only. sourceIPAddrChanged: The device has been unregistered because the IP address in the Contact header of the REGISTER message has changed. The device will be automatically re-registered. No action is necessary. This is applicable for SIP protocol only. sourcePortChanged: The device has been unregistered because the port number in the Contact header of the REGISTER message has changed. The device will be automatically re-registered. No action is necessary. This is applicable for SIP protocol only. registrationSequenceError: A device requested configuration information from the CUCM at an unexpected time. The CUCM no longer had the requested information in memory. invalidCapabilities: The CUCM detected an error in the updated media capabilities reported by the device. The device reported the capabilities in one of the StationUpdateCapabilities message variants. This is applicable for SCCP protocol only. fallbackInitiated The device has initiated a fallback and will automatically re-register to a higher-priority CUCM. No action is necessary. deviceSwitch A second instance of an endpoint with the same device name has registered and assumed control. No action is necessary."
