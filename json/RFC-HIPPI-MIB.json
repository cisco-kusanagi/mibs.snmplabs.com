These signals are used to identify a source to destination as well as a destination to source connection. In addition, 64 bit wide connections (1600 MB) have two (2) additional signals that are referred to as INTERCONNECT-B. These are exactly the same as the INTERCONNECT-A signals but are carried on the second set of cables that make up the 64 bit connection. These signals are encoded into the lowest order four (4) bits of the hippiInterconnectStatus object as follows: 0 0 0 1 INTERCONNECT-A Source to Destination (1) 0 0 1 0 INTERCONNECT-A Destination to Source (2) 0 1 0 0 INTERCONNECT-B Source to Destination (4) 1 0 0 0 INTERCONNECT-B Destination to Source (8)"
