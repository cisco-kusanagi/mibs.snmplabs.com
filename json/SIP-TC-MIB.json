    "description": "This convention defines the role of a SIP entity. Examples of SIP entities are proxies, user agents, redirect servers, registrars, or combinations of the above. User Agent (UA): A logical entity that can act as both a user agent client and user agent server. User Agent Client (UAC): A logical entity that creates a new request, and then uses the client transaction state machinery to send it. The role of UAC lasts only for the duration of that transaction. In other words, if a piece of software initiates a request, it acts as a UAC for the duration of that transaction. If it receives a request later, it assumes the role of a user agent server for the processing of that transaction. User Agent Server (UAS): A logical entity that generates a response to a SIP request. The response accepts, rejects, or redirects the request. This role lasts only for the duration of that transaction. In other words, if a piece of software responds to a request, it acts as a UAS for the duration of that transaction. If it generates a request later, it assumes the role of a user agent client for the processing of that transaction. Proxy, Proxy Server: An intermediary entity that acts as both a server and a client for the purpose of making requests on behalf of other clients. A proxy server primarily plays the role of routing, which means its job is to ensure that a request is sent to another entity 'closer' to the targeted user. Proxies are also useful for enforcing policy. A proxy interprets and, if necessary, rewrites specific parts of a request message before forwarding it. Redirect Server: A redirect server is a user agent server that generates 3xx responses to requests it receives, directing the client to contact an alternate set of URIs. Registrar: A registrar is a server that accepts REGISTER requests and places the information it receives in those requests into the location service for the domain it handles.",
