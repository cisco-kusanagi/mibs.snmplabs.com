    "description": "The MIB module is defined to configure the Announcements feature on the Media Gateway Card. The Media Gateway Card will have the capability to play pre-recorded local announcements in switched VoIP solutions only. Under the control of a call agent, announcements can be played in either direction over existing connections (calls) or towards the Time Division Multiplexed (TDM) network on a TDM endpoint that is terminated on the the Media Gateway Card. A large number of different announcements may be cached on the Media Gateway Card for immediate play out. A persistent announcement store, called the Announcement file server, will exist in the packet network and hold all the announcements in the network. Announcements will be downloaded on demand as announcement files from the configured announcement store. Downloaded announcement files will be stored on the Media Gateway Card as either 'permanent' or 'dynamic' announcement files. Permanent files on the Media Gateway Card are exempt from being refreshed, replaced, or removed without explicit provisioning actions. Dynamic announcement files will not persist across resets. Permanent announcement files will be reloaded, if possible, following a reset. Dynamic announcement files are automatically 'aged'. 'Aged' files are re-fetched from the Announcement file server. Dynamic Announcement files can be replaced on the Media Gateway Card if the Announcement memory on the card is full and additional Announcement files are to be downloaded. The file(s) to be replaced will be determined according to some Least Recently Used(LRU) algorithm. Announcements can be played over established connections and unconnected TDM endpoints in any encoding supported by the Media Gateway Card in its current configuration. Announcement files must be encoded in G.729a to be played on G.729ab connections or, if G.729ab has been chosen as the preferred codec, unconnected endpoints. The Announcement file server will reside on an IP network reachable from the Media Gateway Card using TFTP. The user will configure the Announcement file server node name on the the Media Gateway Card. The Announcement file server will have a 'main' file directory for Announcements. If the Announcement prefix path is configured to begin with a '/' then the directory is absolute. If the prefix path is configured to begin without a '/' then it will be relative to the default TFTP server directory. If no prefix path is configured then the Announcement 'main' directory and the TFTP default directory will be the same. The user must configure subdirectories within the main Announcement directory for each encoding that Announcements may be played in. These subdirectories must be of the following names: 'g711u', 'g711a', 'g726_40k', 'g726_32k', 'g726_24k', 'g726_16k', 'g729_a', 'g7231_high_rate', 'g7231_a_high_rate', 'g7231_low_rate', 'g7231_a_low_rate'. The Media Gateway Card maintains an Announcement cache in resident memory. The cache is populated on demand with dynamic files or provisioned with permanent files. That is to say that when an Announcement is requested to be played it will first be retrieved from the Announcement file server and placed in the on-board Announcement cache. Subsequent requests for the same Announcement will not require retrieval of the Announcement file from the Announcement file server. Note that an Announcement in one encoding is a different file than the same Announcement in a different encoding. The 'Announcement aging' policy is provisionable for dynamic files. Once a dynamic Announcement has 'aged' in the on-board cache it will be 'refreshed' by being retrieved again from the Announcement file server. The age time determines the maximum time before an updated Announcement file is automatically propagated to the card. Shorter age times will result in more frequent file server access. Changing the 'age' time does not affect the age times of dynamic Announcement files currently loaded. However, once these files are refreshed, they will then use the new 'age' time. Announcements may also be provisioned as 'permanent'. A permanent Announcement will be fetched from the Announcement file server and 'frozen' in the Media Gateway Card Announcement cache. Permanent Announcements will be excluded from aging (and being automatically refreshed) and excluded from being replaced if the Announcement cache becomes full. Permanent Announcements can only be removed from the cache explicitly by user through command line interface or through a Network Manager. If the Media Gateway Card is reset, permanent Announcements will be re-fetched from the Announcement file server as soon as the card becomes active. The Announcement encoding must be specified when provisioning permanent Announcements. "
