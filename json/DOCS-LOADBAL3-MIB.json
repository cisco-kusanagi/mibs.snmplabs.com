    "description": "This attribute when set to 'true' triggers the change-over operation for Externally-Directed Load Balancing. Setting this attribute to 'true' is known as a commit operation. A commit operation is considered successful if the CMTS considers that the entered information is valid and the transaction can be initiated. It does not imply that the channel-change operation itself (i.e. UCC, DCC, DBC transaction) reports success or completion. A commit operation is considered unsuccessful if the CMTS determines that there are invalid attributes values in the ChangeOver object such that the change-over operation cannot be initiated. After system initialization all ChangeOver object parameters are set to default values. After a successful commit operation all ChangeOver object parameters are set to default values with the exception of this attribute (commit) that is set to 'true'. An unsuccessful commit operation is rejected and this attribute reports false in subsequent value queries. With regard to error checking on a commit operation, the following aspects are defined: - The CMTS rejects the commit operation when the MAC address in MacAddr attribute is not from an existing and operational cable modem in the CMTS. - The CMTS rejects the commit operation when there is already a change-over operation in progress for the CM, i.e. the corresponding attribute value in the -ChangeOverStatus object is one of 'messageSent', 'modemDeparting' or 'waitToSendMessage'. - The CMTS rejects the commit operation when neither of the upstream or downstream attribute parameters of the change-over operation are set. When the CM is in MRC disabled mode, only UCC/DCC commands are valid, therefore: - The CMTS ignores the values of RcpId, RccId, and ServiceFlowInfo in the commit operation. - The CMTS rejects the commit operation if neither of DownFrequency or UsChSet were set to non-default values. - The CMTS rejects the commit operation when the UsChSet indicates more than one upstream channel. - A single-upstream-channel change-over operation (no downstream information) is rejected if the upstream channel information corresponds to a non-existent channel or a channel with operational status down. - The CMTS rejects the commit operation for a downstream frequency that the CMTS can determine to be invalid. For example, the downstream frequency corresponds to a channel that is part of the MD-DS-SG in which the target CM is currently registered, and this Downstream Channel is known to be operationally down, in a test mode, mute state, etc. - To move a MRC/MTC-capable CM to a MRC/MTC enabled MAC Domain, the operator needs to reinitialize the CM via a DCC operation by including the appropriate DownFrequency and an InitTech allowing only the 'reinitialize MAC' initialization technique. When the CM is in MRC enabled mode, DCC and DBC commands are valid, therefore: - The CMTS rejects the commit operation if both the Downstream Frequency (via the DownFrequency attribute) and the RCC (via the RcpId and RccId) are set to non-default values. - The CMTS rejects the commit operation if the MdIfIndex attribute value is invalid, or if the triplet MdIfIndex, RcpId, RccId does not resolve in a valid RCC, or at least one of the indicated downstream channels is know to be operationally down, in a test mode, mute state, etc. - The CMTS rejects the commit operation if it can detect the UsChSet includes one or more channels that are not part of the US-SG of the CM, or any of those channels are in operational status down. - The CMTS rejects the commit operation if a service flow entry in the ServiceFlowInfo attribute includes channels that are not part of the CMs target RCS or TCS. After processing the commit operation the CMTS creates or overwrites (if it already exists) an instance of the ChgOverStatus object for the associated CM. After a successful commit operation, the CMTS initiates the change-over transaction using the most appropriate technique. The potential techniques are: - UCC - For upstream-channel-only changes on CMs not operating in MRC mode. - DCC - For upstream and/or downstream channel changes on CMs not operating in MRC mode. - DCC followed by channel assignment in REG-RSP-MP - For MAC Domain re-assignment on CMs operating in MRC mode. In this case, the change-over command might only include a downstream frequency, or might include an RCC defined in the target MAC domain. The upstream channel set may or may not be provided. The only applicable Initialization Technique for this operation is 'reinitializeMAC'. - DBC - For upstream and/or downstream channel set changes on CMs operating in MRC mode."

'noOpNeed' A change-over operation was requested in which neither the DS and US channels where the CM is operational changed. 'waitToSendMessage' The specified operation is active and CMTS is waiting to send the channel change message with channel info to the cable modem. 'cmOperationRejected' Channel Change operation was rejected by the cable modem. 'cmtsOperationRejected' Channel Change operation was rejected by the Cable Modem Termination System. 'rejectInit' Operation rejected due to unsupported initialization tech requested.
