Link specific configuration objects are contained in a separate MIB module (e.g., SNA DLC MIB) corresponding to the link type. The table snaNodeAdminLinkTable contains objects which identify the relationship between node instances and link instances. The entries (i.e., rows) in this table can be created by either an Agent or a Management Station. The Management Station can do this through setting the appropriate value in the snaNodeAdminRowStatus. The snaNodeAdminRowStatus object describes the status of an entry and is used to change the status of an entry. The entry is deleted by an Agent based on the value of the snaNodeAdminRowStatus. The snaNodeAdminState object describes the desired operational state of a Node and is used to change the operational state of a Node. For example, such information may be obtained from a configuration file. How an Agent or a Management Station obtains the initial value of each object at creation time is an implementation specific issue. For each entry in this table, there is a corresponding entry in the snaNodeOperTable. While the objects in this table describe the desired or configured operational values of the SNA Node, the actual runtime values are contained in snaNodeOperTable."

The SSCP will inform the remote session LU partner to send an UNBIND request to terminate the session. rshutd(3) - terminate the LU-LU session by sending an SNA RSHUTD (Request ShutDown) request to the remote session LU partner. The remote LU will then send an UNBIND request to terminate the session. poweroff(4) - terminate the LU-LU session by sending either an SNA LUSTAT (LU Status) request on the LU-LU session or an SNA NOTIFY request on the SSCP-LU session indicating that the LU has been powered off.
