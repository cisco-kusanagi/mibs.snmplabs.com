The continued octets are the logic port led. Each octet presents one port. There are two modes: link/act/speed mode and POE mode. The link/act/speed mode presents the speed duplex of port. The POE mode presents if the port deliver power to PD. The POE mode is supported by POE Switch only. The mode is determined by Octet 9. If the switch can not support POE, the mode is link/act/speed only. In each octet: link/act/speed mode: bit 7: 0B = port is not activity 1B = port is activity bit 6: 0B = not combo port 1B = combo port bit 5: the bit is available only when the port is combo port and linkup 0B = fiber linkup 1B = copper linkup bit 4: reserved bit 3: 0B = half duplex 1B = full duplex bit 2-0: 0x0 = link down 0x1 = 10Mbps 0x2 = 100Mbps 0x3 = 1000Mbps 0x4 = 10Gbps POE mode: 0x01 = no deliver power to PD 0x02 = deliver power to PD."
