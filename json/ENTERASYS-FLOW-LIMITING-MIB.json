Alternately, an administrator may choose to configure an interface with a small print server as a userPort since their flow setup needs may be similar to that of a user port. aggregatedUserPort A port likely to have multiple end stations attached either through a wireless access point or an unmanaged low cost hub or switch. It is expected that this class may also be used instead of interSwitchLink when switches are interconnected using a lower speed link. interSwitchLink A port that is used as a high-speed interconnect between two intelligent switches or routers. Unspecified A port in which nothing can be assumed about its intended use. These classes are only guides.

The process of dropping flow setup requests and their associated packets could cause end stations attached to this interface to behave in an indeterminate manner. The use of this option may also prevent the entity from being able to count additional flows and from reaching any additional configured limit. createDiscardFlows(2) - Create discard flows and discard the associated packets. The use of this option could cause end stations attached to this interface to behave in an indeterminate manner. disableInterface(3) - Operationally disable the interface, ifOperStatus for the interface MUST go into the 'down' state, and MUST remain in that state until the associated etsysFlowLimitingIntfStatus is set to operational, the Flow Limiting feature is disabled, or the entity is reset. The 'generateNotification(0)' will always be performed if it is a selected action, is globally enabled, and does not exceed the global rate limit for such notifications. It MUST be generated in such a way that the information in the notification indicates the condition on the interface after any other indicated action has been taken. If one or more other actions are selected only the one with the highest precedence will be taken. The order of precedence, from highest to lowest, of the actions are 'disableInterface', 'createDiscardFlows', and finally 'dropExcessFlows'. If etsysFlowLimitingSystemInterfaceShutdown is disabled the selected action with the next highest precedence will be taken."
