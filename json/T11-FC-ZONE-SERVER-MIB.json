    "description": "The MIB module for the management of Fibre Channel Zoning Servers, both for Basic Zoning Management and for Enhanced Zoning Management, as defined in the FC-GS-5 specification. FC-GS-5 defines (in-band) management operations for manipulating the Zone Set Database, some for use in Basic mode (e.g., 'Add Zone Set (AZS)', etc.), and some for use in Enhanced mode (e.g., Create Zone Set (CZS)', etc.). When Enhanced Zoning Management is in use, FC-GS-5 requires that these in-band management operations be rejected unless they are issued within the context of a GS-5 server session. The use of a server session ensures serialized access to the Zoning Database since the Fabric lock for the Zone Server must be obtained as a part of establishing the server session to the Zone Server. Thus, if and when this MIB is used for Enhanced Zoning Management, SNMP SetRequests that request the modification of zoning definitions must be serialized with respect to the GS-5 requests to modify the Zoning Database. This is achieved by requiring that an SNMP management application must first obtain the Fabric lock for the Zone Server before attempting to modify any zoning definitions. The companion T11-FC-FABRIC-LOCK-MIB module is defined as a means of obtaining the Fabric lock for the Zone Server (or any other server). In Enhanced Zoning Management, a Zone Server keeps track of changes requested in the zoning definitions, but does not update its Zone Set Database unless there is (and until there is) a 'commit' operation. To model this behavior, this MIB module assumes that a Zone Server (in Enhanced mode) takes a snapshot of its Zone Set Database as and when the Fabric lock (for the Zone Server application) is obtained; this snapshot is used to create what is herein called the 'copy' database. It is this 'copy' database that is then updated by SNMP SetRequests (while the Fabric is locked). If and when a 'commit' operation is requested (while the Fabric is still locked), the 'copy' database is then used to overwrite the previously committed contents of the Zone Set Database, and the new Zone Set Database is distributed to all other switches in the Fabric. When the lock is released, any changes made that were not 'committed' are discarded. When this MIB is used for Basic Zoning Management, the same set of MIB objects as used for Enhanced mode are used to make changes to the Database of a Zone Server on a particular switch, but the changes take immediate effect at that switch without an explicit commit. The distribution of those changes to Zone Servers on other switches in the Fabric is subsequently requested through the use of a separate set of MIB objects. The management information specified in this MIB module includes the Zoning Database for each of one or more Fibre Channel Fabrics. A Zoning Database is a combination of the Fabric's Zone Set Database and its Active Zone Set. The Active Zone Set is the Zone Set currently enforced by the Fabric; a Zone Set Database is a database of the Zone Sets available to be activated within a Fabric. All the MIB objects representing a Zone Set Database are modifiable at any time (irrespective of the value of any RowStatus object), whereas all objects representing the Active Zone Set are always read-only (except to deactivate it and/or activate a different one).
