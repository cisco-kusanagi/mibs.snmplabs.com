The value coldStandby indicates the resource is a backup for another resource but will not be immediately able to take over the role of the backed up resource and will require some initialization activity. The value providingService indicates that this component, as a backup resource, is currently backing up another resource."

Note that the multiport cell-based cards have one common clock source for all ports. For this reason, the following rules apply for the value of clockingSource across the board's three ports: All three clockingSource values must be 'local' OR All three clockingSource values must be 'module' OR One clockingSource value must be 'line' and the other two must be 'otherPort'. The there is no NS component provisioned, the default value for this attribute will be local. If the NS component has been provisioned, the default value is module, except for the 1pDS3C cards. For the 1pDS3C cards, the default and only valid value for this attribute is local. The clockingSource of the DS1 sub-component becomes the effective clocking source for this attribute. All the DS1 sub-components have the same clocking source."

An OCD anomaly occurs when 7 consecutive incorrect HECs have been detected. An OCD anomaly terminates when 6 consecutive correct HECs have been detected. For an AtmCell component located under a DS3 or E3 component with mapping = PLCP, the LCD defect is directly derived from the PLCP LOF defect. If LCD defects are intermittently occurring, the LCD defect accumulator is decremented at a rate of 1/10 of the incrementing rate (alarm integration ratio of 1/10), with all measurements based on a 200 ms polling cycle The component under which is located the AtmCell component goes into an operational state of disabled until the LCD alarm condition is cleared. The condition is cleared after the LCD defect has not been reported for a period of 10 seconds +/- 0.5 seconds. The lcdAlarm attribute is always set to off when the parent of the AtmCell component has been locked and left offline. This can also happen when the Path or Channel component has been suspended since its parent has been locked."

If the zeroCoding is B8ZS (where supported on the FP) or none, the timeslot's data rate will be 64kbit/s. If the zeroCoding option is bit7Stuffing, the data rate of a timeslot will be 56kbit/s. When 56kbit/s is selected for a channel on a DS1, the least significant bit of each timeslot of this Channel will always be set to 1 and not used for data. The data rate for the timeslots of this channel is therefore restricted to 56kbit/s.

The result is presented in the form of xEsyy, where x is the mantissa; and syy is the exponent, for example 0E+00, 2E-09. Note that the bitErrorRate is an estimate only.

    "description": "This attribute displays whether the Loss of Cell Delineation (LCD) failure alarm state has been entered. This state is entered when LCD defects have been observed and accumulated for a period of time specified through the alarmActDelay attribute. In ATM cell direct mapping mode, an LCD defect occurs when Out of Cell Delineation (OCD) anomaly persists for x milliseconds, and disappears when the Out of Cell Delineation (OCD) is absent for x msec. An OCD anomaly occurs when 7 consecutive incorrect HECs have been detected. An OCD anomaly terminates when 6 consecutive correct HECs have been detected. For an AtmCell component located under a DS3 or E3 component with mapping = PLCP, the LCD defect is directly derived from the PLCP LOF defect. If LCD defects are intermittently occurring, the LCD defect accumulator is decremented at a rate of 1/10 of the incrementing rate (alarm integration ratio of 1/10), with all measurements based on a 200 ms polling cycle The component under which is located the AtmCell component goes into an operational state of disabled until the LCD alarm condition is cleared. The condition is cleared after the LCD defect has not been reported for a period of 10 seconds +/- 0.5 seconds. The lcdAlarm attribute is always set to off when the parent of the AtmCell component has been locked and left offline. This can also happen when the Path or Channel component has been suspended since its parent has been locked."

Note that the multiport cell-based cards have one common clock source for each of the three ports. For this reason, the following rules apply for the value of clockingSource across the board's three ports: All three clockingSource values must be 'local' OR All three clockingSource values must be 'module' OR One clockingSource value must be 'line' and the other two must be 'otherPort'. The default value for this attribute will be module if a CP clock is available, and local otherwise."

The result is presented in the form of xEsyy, where x is the mantissa; and syy is the exponent, for example 0E+00, 2E-09. Note that the bitErrorRate is an estimate only.

An OCD anomaly occurs when 7 consecutive incorrect HECs have been detected. An OCD anomaly terminates when 6 consecutive correct HECs have been detected. For an AtmCell component located under a DS3 or E3 component with mapping = PLCP, the LCD defect is directly derived from the PLCP LOF defect. If LCD defects are intermittently occurring, the LCD defect accumulator is decremented at a rate of 1/10 of the incrementing rate (alarm integration ratio of 1/10), with all measurements based on a 200 ms polling cycle The component under which is located the AtmCell component goes into an operational state of disabled until the LCD alarm condition is cleared. The condition is cleared after the LCD defect has not been reported for a period of 10 seconds +/- 0.5 seconds. The lcdAlarm attribute is always set to off when the parent of the AtmCell component has been locked and left offline. This can also happen when the Path or Channel component has been suspended since its parent has been locked."

If the zeroCoding is B8ZS (where supported on the FP) or none, the timeslot's data rate will be 64kbit/s. If the zeroCoding option is bit7Stuffing, the data rate of a timeslot will be 56kbit/s. When 56kbit/s is selected for a channel on a DS1, the least significant bit of each timeslot of this Channel will always be set to 1 and not used for data. The data rate for the timeslots of this channel is therefore restricted to 56kbit/s.

In ATM cell direct mapping mode, an LCD defect occurs when Out of Cell Delineation (OCD) anomaly persists for x milliseconds, and disappears when the Out of Cell Delineation (OCD) is absent for x msec. An OCD anomaly occurs when 7 consecutive incorrect HECs have been detected. An OCD anomaly terminates when 6 consecutive correct HECs have been detected. For an AtmCell component located under a DS3 or E3 component with mapping = PLCP, the LCD defect is directly derived from the PLCP LOF defect. If LCD defects are intermittently occurring, the LCD defect accumulator is decremented at a rate of 1/10 of the incrementing rate (alarm integration ratio of 1/10), with all measurements based on a 200 ms polling cycle The component under which is located the AtmCell component goes into an operational state of disabled until the LCD alarm condition is cleared. The condition is cleared after the LCD defect has not been reported for a period of 10 seconds +/- 0.5 seconds. The lcdAlarm attribute is always set to off when the parent of the AtmCell component has been locked and left offline. This can also happen when the Path or Channel component has been suspended since its parent has been locked."

The result is presented in the form of xEsyy, where x is the mantissa; and syy is the exponent, for example 0E+00, 2E-09. Note that the bitErrorRate is an estimate only. For more reliable test results, the test should be done over a long period. Multiple tests would also improve the confidence level of the test results.

If the multiframe LOF defects are intermittently occurring, the multiframe LOF defect accumulator is decremented at a rate of 1/10 of the incrementing rate (alarm integration ratio of 1/10), with all measurements based on a 200 ms polling cycle. The alarm is cleared when the defect is not detected for 10 seconds +/- 0.5 seconds. When the multiframe LOF alarm is on, a multiframe RAI alarm indicator is transmitted on the line.

If the zeroCoding is B8ZS (where supported on the FP) or none, the timeslot's data rate will be 64kbit/s. If the zeroCoding option is bit7Stuffing, the data rate of a timeslot will be 56kbit/s. When 56kbit/s is selected for a channel on a DS1, the least significant bit of each timeslot of this Channel will always be set to 1 and not used for data.

An operator CID of 0 is used to identify the Network Manager (referred to as 'NetMan' in DPN). This CID matches the CID of any component. Values 1 to 8191 inclusive (equivalent to 'basic CIDs' in DPN) may be assigned to specific customers."

    "description": "This attribute displays whether the Loss of Cell Delineation (LCD) failure alarm state has been entered. This state is entered when LCD defects have been observed and accumulated for a period of time specified through the alarmActDelay attribute. In ATM cell direct mapping mode, an LCD defect occurs when Out of Cell Delineation (OCD) anomaly persists for x milliseconds, and disappears when the Out of Cell Delineation (OCD) is absent for x msec. An OCD anomaly occurs when 7 consecutive incorrect HECs have been detected. An OCD anomaly terminates when 6 consecutive correct HECs have been detected. For an AtmCell component located under a DS3 or E3 component with mapping = PLCP, the LCD defect is directly derived from the PLCP LOF defect. If LCD defects are intermittently occurring, the LCD defect accumulator is decremented at a rate of 1/10 of the incrementing rate (alarm integration ratio of 1/10), with all measurements based on a 200 ms polling cycle The component under which is located the AtmCell component goes into an operational state of disabled until the LCD alarm condition is cleared. The condition is cleared after the LCD defect has not been reported for a period of 10 seconds +/- 0.5 seconds. The lcdAlarm attribute is always set to off when the parent of the AtmCell component has been locked and left offline. This can also happen when the Path or Channel component has been suspended since its parent has been locked."

The result is presented in the form of xEsyy, where x is the mantissa; and syy is the exponent, for example 0E+00, 2E-09. Note that the bitErrorRate is an estimate only.

Every operator session also has a CID, which is the CID provisioned for the operator's user ID. An operator will see only the stream data for components having a matching CID. Also, the operator will be allowed to issue commands for only those components which have a matching CID. An operator CID of 0 is used to identify the Network Manager (referred to as 'NetMan' in DPN). This CID matches the CID of any component.

If a component has a cid attribute, the component's CID is the provisioned value of that attribute; otherwise the component inherits the CID of its parent. The top- level component has a CID of 0. Every operator session also has a CID, which is the CID provisioned for the operator's user ID. An operator will see only the stream data for components having a matching CID. Also, the operator will be allowed to issue commands for only those components which have a matching CID. An operator CID of 0 is used to identify the Network Manager (referred to as 'NetMan' in DPN). This CID matches the CID of any component. Values 1 to 8191 inclusive (equivalent to 'basic CIDs' in DPN) may be assigned to specific customers."

An OCD anomaly occurs when 7 consecutive incorrect HECs have been detected. An OCD anomaly terminates when 6 consecutive correct HECs have been detected. For an AtmCell component located under a DS3 or E3 component with mapping = PLCP, the LCD defect is directly derived from the PLCP LOF defect. If LCD defects are intermittently occurring, the LCD defect accumulator is decremented at a rate of 1/10 of the incrementing rate (alarm integration ratio of 1/10), with all measurements based on a 200 ms polling cycle The component under which is located the AtmCell component goes into an operational state of disabled until the LCD alarm condition is cleared. The condition is cleared after the LCD defect has not been reported for a period of 10 seconds +/- 0.5 seconds. The lcdAlarm attribute is always set to off when the parent of the AtmCell component has been locked and left offline.

The result is presented in the form of xEsyy, where x is the mantissa; and syy is the exponent, for example 0E+00, 2E-09. Note that the bitErrorRate is an estimate only.

When adding a Sonet/Sdh component, the clockingSource attribute is set to module if the NetworkSynchronization component has been added and is set to local otherwise.

For this reason, it is not allowed to have at the same time the clockingSource attribute set to local on one port and module on another port. Furthermore, the clockingSource attribute cannot be set to module if the NetworkSynchronization component has not been added."

If the LOF defects are intermittently occurring, the LOF defect accumulator is decremented at a rate of 1/10 of the incrementing rate (alarm integration ratio of 1/10), with all measurements based on a 200 ms polling cycle. The Sonet/Sdh component goes into an operational state of disabled until the LOF alarm condition is cleared. The condition is cleared when framing has been achieved for a period of 10 seconds +/- 0.5 seconds. The lofAlarm attribute is always set to off when the component has been locked and left offline."

An OCD anomaly occurs when 7 consecutive incorrect HECs have been detected. An OCD anomaly terminates when 6 consecutive correct HECs have been detected. For an AtmCell component located under a DS3 or E3 component with mapping = PLCP, the LCD defect is directly derived from the PLCP LOF defect. If LCD defects are intermittently occurring, the LCD defect accumulator is decremented at a rate of 1/10 of the incrementing rate (alarm integration ratio of 1/10), with all measurements based on a 200 ms polling cycle The component under which is located the AtmCell component goes into an operational state of disabled until the LCD alarm condition is cleared.

The result is presented in the form of xEsyy, where x is the mantissa; and syy is the exponent, for example 0E+00, 2E-09. Note that the bitErrorRate is an estimate only.

An OCD anomaly occurs when 7 consecutive incorrect HECs have been detected. An OCD anomaly terminates when 6 consecutive correct HECs have been detected. For an AtmCell component located under a DS3 or E3 component with mapping = PLCP, the LCD defect is directly derived from the PLCP LOF defect. If LCD defects are intermittently occurring, the LCD defect accumulator is decremented at a rate of 1/10 of the incrementing rate (alarm integration ratio of 1/10), with all measurements based on a 200 ms polling cycle The component under which is located the AtmCell component goes into an operational state of disabled until the LCD alarm condition is cleared. The condition is cleared after the LCD defect has not been reported for a period of 10 seconds +/- 0.5 seconds. The lcdAlarm attribute is always set to off when the parent of the AtmCell component has been locked and left offline. This can also happen when the Path or Channel component has been suspended since its parent has been locked."
