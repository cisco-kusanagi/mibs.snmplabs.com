    "description": "This MIB module defines managed objects that facilitate the management of Smart Install feature. Smart Install is a plug-and-play image and configuration management feature which enables zero-touch deployment of Cisco network devices in an enterprise branch network. Following is the terminology associated with Smart Install feature: Director A router or switch selected as the single management point for images and configuration of network devices in a Smart Install network. When a device is first installed into the network, the director detects the new device and facilitates the correct Cisco IOS image and configuration file for the device based on user defined profiles. With the automated process, a single or a group of devices are deployed without user intervention. The managed device includes, but not limited to, Cisco 2K/3K switches and EtherSwitch service modules. Director learns about them through CDP or Smart Install protocol. Smart Install Capable Client A client device running Smart Install capable image. Group Devices are placed into Groups where they can be manipulated together rather than individually. Profile Profile is the configuration file, image, etc. that a user programs for each group. Backup The feature to archive/backup client device's configuration file upon 'write memory' on client. Join-Window A join window is a time window during which the device is allowed to upgrade image or configuration files. Only during this window can the director provide information about the image and configuration to the device. A device attempting to join the network outside of the join window will not be allowed to do so, and cannot upgrade their image and configuration files. This MIB module is supported on the director but not on the client devices. It is designed to: - Allow operators to make configurations for client devices before and after they connect to the director's network. - Support monitoring of client devices discovered by the director. - Provide status of the deployed client image and configuration as a result of operator defined profiles. - Provide notifications for notable events such as new device joined or upgrade failure if there is any. Please note that, in most cases a working DHCP pool is configured for the subnet(s) on which the client devices are located. The DHCP server could be the director, another Cisco device running Cisco IOS, or a non-Cisco third-party server. CISCO-SMART-INSTALL-MIB Module usage: 1) Create profile for a group of devices Profile is used to pre-configure image and configuration files for a group of devices. In csiProfileTable { csiProfileIndex = 8, csiProfileGroupName = '3750E_24', csiProfileImageUrl = 'tftp://10.0.0.1/3750e.tar', csiProfileImageTwoUrl = '', csiProfileConfigUrl = 'flash:/default_config.txt', <snip> } 2) Define a group of devices For example, to define a group matching on Catalyst 2960 24 8 Poe switches: In csiMatchTable { csiMatchIndex = 1, csiMatchGroupType = 'product', csiMatchProductId = 'WS-C2960-24LT-L', csiProfileIndex = 6, <snip> } 3) Enable Smart Install feature on the director The operator enables the Smart Install feature by setting csiOperationMode = basic(2) 4) Display device information Director is aware of Smart Install capable devices and others connected to a Smart Install capable device. This MIB table displays information about the devices, such as the running image, the MAC address, etc. csiDeviceTable 5) Further refine the running environment Objects in csiGlobalConfig enable the Operator to tailor the director operation, such as: . Backup client device's configuration file. . Set up Join Window to monitor newly installed devices."

Thus the value of this object starts at 2 and monotonically increases after a profile is created. The Network Management Application reads this variable and uses the non-zero value when creating a new row with an SNMP SET. When the SET is performed, the agent must determine whether the value is indeed still unused, for two Network Management Applications may attempt to create a row (profile entry) simultaneously and use the same value. If it is currently unused, the SET succeeds and the agent increases the value of this object. If the value is in use, however, the SET fails. The Network Management Application must then re-read this variable to obtain a new usable value."
