'cepRdi'(5) - Circuit Emulation over Packet Remote Defect Indication. Remote Defect Indication (RDI) is generated by the remote CEP de-packetizer when LOPS is detected.

Similarly, 'unequipped' MUST cause payload suppression when an unequipped condition is detected on the SONET/SDH PATH/VT. During DBA condition, CEP packets will continue to be sent, but with indicators set in the CEP header instructing the remote to play all ones (for AIS) or all zeros (for unequipped) onto its SONET/SDH path. NOTE: Some implementations may not support this feature. In these cases, this object should be read-only."
