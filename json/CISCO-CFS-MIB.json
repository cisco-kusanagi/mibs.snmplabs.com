    "description": "This MIB applies to one or more of a set of devices which have connectivity through some kind of 'fabric'. Many features which run in such an environment require the exchange of information between the peer devices which participate in providing the feature. An example of the type of information exchanged is configuration information. It would be advantageous to have the ability to have configuration for a feature done on one device and propagated to all other devices in the fabric. Cisco Fabric Service (CFS) is a general mechanism for data distribution within the fabric that could be used by most features. A feature supported in a device may or may not be CFS capable. In case a feature is CFS capable, the control of the CFS operations are instrumented through this MIB. A CFS capable feature can be enabled for data distribution within the fabric by the user via SNMP. When a CFS capable feature is enabled for data distribution, CFS operations can then be performed for that particular feature. As part of the CFS configuration the first mandatory step is to explicitly enable the feature for data distribution. This enabling of distribution for a feature needs to be done for those devices in the fabric where the distribution is intended. Following this mandatory step, feature specific configurations can be instrumented in the respective MIBs. Once a feature is enabled for data distribution, first subsequent feature specific configuration SET operation results in a snapshot of current 'Running Configuration' of the feature, on the local device. This snapshot is used for subsequent modifications by feature specific SET operations. Such modified configuration is referred to as 'Pending Configuration'. There can only be one 'Pending Configuration' in the fabric. Additionally, such 'Pending Configuration' can be maintained within the context of additional scope, specific to the respective features. The user who initiates the creation of the 'Pending Configuration' is its owner. When a 'Pending Configuration' for a feature exists in one of the devices of the fabric, an attempt to create a 'Pending Configuration' for the same feature and on a different device by way of feature specific SET operation results in an error. This means feature specific SET operations intended for distribution can only be performed on the device that has the 'Pending Configuration' with it. This ensures data consistency for distribution. Once the configuration of a feature is ready to be distributed to all devices connected to the fabric, a 'commit' action performed on the local device overwrites the local 'Running Configuration' and then distributes the new local 'Running Configuration' to all other devices in the fabric. The successful 'commit' action also results into destroying of the 'Pending Configuration' and makes the feature available for new distribution. Any attempt to perform 'commit' without any modification results in to an error. The 'commit' action can only be performed by the owner of the 'Pending Configuration'. The 'Pending Configuration' can optionally be destroyed without any distribution. This can be done by using either 'abort' or 'clear' action. The 'abort' action needs to performed only on that device where the 'Pending Configuration' exists and can only be performed by the owner of the 'Pending Configuration'. The 'clear' action can be initiated through any of the devices in the fabric. The successful 'abort' or 'clear' operation makes the feature available for new distribution. The CFS, in addition to providing the basic distribution infrastructure to the CFS capable features in a stable fabric, also provides infrastructure to handle data distribution when two stable fabrics merge. This MIB module is to facilitate the global level control (enabling/disabling) and actions (commit/abort/clear) over the CFS capable features in the system. Glossary of the terms used in this MIB: -------------------------------------- VSAN - Virtual Storage Area Network, similar to a VLAN. CFS feature Scope - The scope of distribution. The scope provides the context within which the CFS actions are performed on a CFS capable feature. CFS Fabric Merge - The merging of two stable fabrics. The CFS provides infrastructure to handle data distribution for CFS distribution enabled features when the two stable fabrics merge. CFS control and actions : CFS Distribution Enable - This is to enable data distribution for CFS capable feature. CFS Distribution Disable - This is to disable data distribution for CFS capable feature. CFS Commit - This is to commit the 'Pending Configuration' on the local device. This action triggers the distribution of the 'Pending Configuration' to all the devices in the fabric. CFS Abort - This is to Destroy the 'Pending Configuration' on the local device without any distribution. Once local 'Pending Configuration' is destroyed, creation of 'Pending Configuration' in the local or any other device connected to the fabric is allowed. CFS Clear - This is to Destroy the 'Pending Configuration' that exists in any of the device in the fabric. Once 'Pending Configuration' that exists with one of the devices in the fabric is destroyed, creation of 'Pending Configuration' in the local or any other device connected to the fabric is allowed. "
