    "description": "The MIB module to describe DS1/E1 interface objects. This is an extension to the standard DS1/E1 MIB (RFC 2495). Unless mentioned, the DS1 interface refers to both T1/E1 interfaces. Terminology ( Taken From RFC2495) AIS - Alarm Indication Signal LOS - Loss Of Signal LOF - Loss Of Frame Yellow Alarm - Far End LOF. Red Alarm - Near End LOF. BPV - Bipolar Violation for an AMI-coded signal is the occurrence of a pulse of the same polarity as the previous pulse. A BPV error event for a B8ZS- or HDB3- coded signal is the occurrence of a pulse of the same polarity as the previous pulse without being part of the zero substitution code. (See TR-TSV-000773 Section 3.5.1.1) EXZ - An Excessive Zeroes error event for an AMI-coded signal is the occurrence of more than fifteen contiguous zeroes. For a B8ZS coded signal, the defect occurs when more than seven contiguous zeroes are detected. LCV - Line Coding Violation is the occurrence of either Bipolar Violation (BPV) or Excessive Zeroes (EXZ) error event. PCV - A Path Coding Violation error event is a frame synchronization bit error in the D4 and E1-noCRC formats, or a CRC or frame synch. bit error in the ESF and E1-CRC formats. (Also known as CV-P; See T1.231 Section 6.5.2.1) CS - A Controlled Slip is the replication or deletion of the payload bits of a DS1 frame. (See T1.231 Section 6.1.1.2.3) A Controlled Slip may be performed when there is a difference between the timing of a synchronous receiving terminal and the received signal. A Controlled Slip does not cause an Out of Frame defect. LES - Line Errored Seconds. A LES is a second in which one or more LCV error events are detected. (See TR-TSV-000773 Section 3.5.1.1) ES - Errored Seconds (ES). For ESF and E1-CRC links an ES is a second with one or more PCV or one or more OOF defects OR one or more CS events OR a detected AIS defect. (See TR-TSV-000773 Section 3.5.1.1) For D4 and EN-noCRC links, the presence of BPVs also triggers an ES. This is not incremented during an UAS. BES - Bursty Errored Seconds. A BES is a second with fewer than 1 PCV error events, no Severely Errored Frame defects and no detected incoming AIS defects. The CS are not included in this parameter. This is not incremented during an UAS. It applies to ESF signals only. SES - Severely Errored Seconds. A SES for ESF signals is a second with 320 or more PCV error events OR one or more OOF defects OR a detected AIS defect. (See TR-TSV-000773 Section 3.5.1.1) For E1-CRC signals, a SES is a second with 832 or PCV error events OR one or more OOF defects. For E1-noCRC signals, a SES is a 2048 LCVs or more. For D4 signals, a SES is a count of one second intervals with Framing Error events, or an OOF defect, or 1544 LCVs or more. SEFS - Severely Errored Framing Second. An SESF is a second with one or more OOF defects OR a detected AIS defect. (Also known as SAS-P (SEF/AIS second). (See TR-TSV-000773 Section 3.5.1.1) DM - Degraded Minutes. A DM is one in which the estimated error rate exceeds 1E-6 but does not exceed 1E-3. UAS - Unavailable Seconds. The UAS are calculated by counting the number of seconds that the interface is unavailable. CSS - Controlled Slip Seconds. A CSS is a one-second interval containing one or more controlled slips. This is not incremented during an Unavailable Second. LSES - Line Severely Errored Seconds is defined as a count of 1-second intervals with 1544 Bipolar Violations plus Excessive Zeros event or one or more LOS defects. PSAS - Path SEF/AIS (PSAS) encountered. "

    "description": "This variable indicates the variety of DS1 Line implementing this circuit. The type of circuit affects the number of bits per second that the circuit can reasonably carry, as well as the interpretation of the usage and error statistics. The reasons behind adding 'cds1Linetype' object (apart from 'dsx1LineType' in DS1-MIB.my) for 'line type', with enums from 'other(1)' to 'dsx2E2(11)' replicated, are following: 1) Addition of the two new enums (viz. 'dsx1E1Q50' and 'dsx1E1Q50CRC') in the standard DS1-MIB might not take place in near future; that's why it was decided to have a new object 'cds1LineType'. 2) A way was needed to be provided to configure 'line type' from CLI (Command Line Interface) for service modules supporting line type values from 'dsx1LineType' as well as 'cds1LineType', without having to modify two separate parameters and at the same time, making sure that CLI parameter values directly map to the MIB values. Hence, enums from 'other(1)' to 'dsx2E2(11)' from object 'dsx1LineType' are replicated, and the new enums are added as 'dsx1E1Q50(20)' and 'dsx1E1Q50CRC(21)'. The gap between 'dsx2E2(11)' and 'dsx1E1Q50(20)' provides a safe margin in the case of modifications in 'dsx1LineType' in future; so the CLI can still have the same enums as the standard MIB. It is to be noted that objects 'dsx1LineType' and 'cds1LineType' are mutually exclusive. Setting both in a SET request (with the exception of value 'other(1)') should result into an 'INCONSISTENT VALUE' error. In the case of successive 'SET' requests, the value associated with the latest request should prevail irrespective of the object ('dsx1LineType' or 'cds1LineType') used. Following values reflect the corresponding values in 'dsx1LineType' object in DS1-MIB. dsx1ESF Extended SuperFrame DS1 (T1.107) dsx1D4 AT&T D4 format DS1 (T1.107) dsx1E1 ITU-T Recommendation G.704 (Table 4a) dsx1E1-CRC ITU-T Recommendation G.704 (Table 4b) dsxE1-MF G.704 (Table 4a) with TS16 multiframing enabled dsx1E1-CRC-MF G.704 (Table 4b) with TS16 multiframing enabled dsx1Unframed DS1 with No Framing dsx1E1Unframed E1 with No Framing (G.703) dsx1DS2M12 DS2 frame format (T1.107) dsx1E2 E2 frame format (G.704) The recommended value for 'dsx1LineType' object is 'other'(1) for following values. dsx1E1Q50(20) ITU-T G.704 with TS16 bits 5,7,8 set to 101. In all the other cases TS16 bits 5,7,8 set to 111.(Table 14) dsx1E1Q50CRC(21): dsx1E1Q50 with CRC.
