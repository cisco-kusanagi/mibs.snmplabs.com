Information about RTP streams being sent to an RTP session by a particular sender. 3. Information about RTP streams received on an RTP session by a particular receiver from a particular sender. There are two types of RTP Systems, RTP hosts and RTP monitors. As described below, certain objects are unique to a particular type of RTP System. An RTP host may also function as an RTP monitor.
