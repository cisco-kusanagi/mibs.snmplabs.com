Allows the use of the SNA Character Stream (SCS) and SCS control codes on the session. SCS is used with LU type 1 SNA sessions. dataStreamCtl (Printer sessions only). Allows the use of the standard 3270 data stream. This corresponds to LU type 3 SNA sessions. responses Provides support for positive and negative response handling. Allows the server to reflect to the client any and all definite, exception, and no response requests sent by the host application. bindImage Allows the server to send the SNA Bind image and Unbind notification to the client. sysreq Allows the client and server to emulate some (or all, depending on the server) of the functions of the SYSREQ key in an SNA environment."
