For E1 links, an Out Of Frame defect is declared when three consecutive frame alignment signals have been received with an error (see G.706 Section 4.1 [17]). Once an Out Of Frame Defect is declared, the framer starts searching for a correct framing pattern. The Out of Frame defect ends when the signal is in frame. In-frame occurs when there are fewer than two frame bit errors within 3 msec period for ESF signals and 0.75 msec for D4 signals. For E1 links, in-frame occurs when a) in frame N the frame alignment signal is correct and b) in frame N+1 the frame alignment signal is absent (i.e., bit 2 in TS0 is a one) and c) in frame N+2 the frame alignment signal is present and correct."

The DS1 interface is said to be unavailable from the onset of 10 contiguous SESs, or the onset of the condition leading to a failure (see Failure States). If the condition leading to the failure was immediately preceded by one or more contiguous SESs, then the DS1 interface unavailability starts from the onset of these SESs. Once unavailable, and if no failure is present, the DS1 interface becomes available at the onset of 10 contiguous seconds with no SESs. Once unavailable, and if a failure is present, the DS1 interface becomes available at the onset of 10 contiguous seconds with no SESs, if the failure clearing time is less than or equal to 10 seconds. If the failure clearing time is more than 10 seconds, the DS1 interface becomes available at the onset of 10 contiguous seconds with no SESs, or the onset period leading to the successful clearing condition, whichever occurs later. With respect to the DS1 error counts, all counters are incremented while the DS1 interface is deemed available. While the interface is deemed unavailable, the only count that is incremented is UASs."

If the condition leading to the failure was immediately preceded by one or more contiguous PSESs, then the DS3 interface unavailability starts from the onset of these PSESs. Once unavailable, and if no failure is present, the DS3 interface becomes available at the onset of 10 contiguous seconds with no PSESs. Once unavailable, and if a failure is present, the DS3 interface becomes available at the onset of 10 contiguous seconds with no PSESs, if the failure clearing time is less than or equal to 10 seconds. If the failure clearing time is more than 10 seconds, the DS3 interface becomes available at the onset of 10 contiguous seconds with no PSESs, or the onset period leading to the successful clearing condition, whichever occurs later. With respect to the DS3 error counts, all counters are incremented while the DS3 interface is deemed available. While the interface is deemed unavailable, the only count that is incremented is UASs."
