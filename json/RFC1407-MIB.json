(3) Values are given for ifTable and ifXTable. (4) Example usage of ifStackTable is included. (5) dsx3IfIndex has been deprecated. (6) The definition of valid intervals has been clarified for the case where the agent proxied for other devices. In particular, the treatment of missing intervals has been clarified. (7) An inward loopback has been added. (8) Additional lineStatus bits have been added for Near End in Unavailable Signal State, Carrier Equipment Out of Service. (9) A read-write line Length object has been added. (10) Added a lineStatus last change, trap and enabler. (11) Textual Conventions for statistics objects have been used. (12) A new object, dsx3LoopbackStatus, has been introduced to reflect the loopbacks established on a DS3/E3 interface and the source to the requests. dsx3LoopbackConfig continues to be the desired loopback state while dsx3LoopbackStatus reflects the actual state. (13) A dual loopback has been added to allow the setting of an inward loopback and a line loopback at the same time. (14) An object has been added to indicated whether or not this is a channelized DS3/E3. (15) A new object has been added to indicate which DS1 is to set for remote loopback."

    "description": "This table is deprecated in favour of using ifStackTable. Implementation of this table was optional. It was designed for those systems dividing a DS3/E3 into channels containing different data streams that are of local interest. The DS3/E3 fractional table identifies which DS3/E3 channels associated with a CSU are being used to support a logical interface, i.e., an entry in the interfaces table from the Internet- standard MIB. For example, consider a DS3 device with 4 high speed links carrying router traffic, a feed for voice, a feed for video, and a synchronous channel for a non-routed protocol. We might describe the allocation of channels, in the dsx3FracTable, as follows: dsx3FracIfIndex.2. 1 = 3 dsx3FracIfIndex.2.15 = 4 dsx3FracIfIndex.2. 2 = 3 dsx3FracIfIndex.2.16 = 6 dsx3FracIfIndex.2. 3 = 3 dsx3FracIfIndex.2.17 = 6 dsx3FracIfIndex.2. 4 = 3 dsx3FracIfIndex.2.18 = 6 dsx3FracIfIndex.2. 5 = 3 dsx3FracIfIndex.2.19 = 6 dsx3FracIfIndex.2. 6 = 3 dsx3FracIfIndex.2.20 = 6 dsx3FracIfIndex.2. 7 = 4 dsx3FracIfIndex.2.21 = 6 dsx3FracIfIndex.2. 8 = 4 dsx3FracIfIndex.2.22 = 6 dsx3FracIfIndex.2. 9 = 4 dsx3FracIfIndex.2.23 = 6 dsx3FracIfIndex.2.10 = 4 dsx3FracIfIndex.2.24 = 6 dsx3FracIfIndex.2.11 = 4 dsx3FracIfIndex.2.25 = 6 dsx3FracIfIndex.2.12 = 5 dsx3FracIfIndex.2.26 = 6 dsx3FracIfIndex.2.13 = 5 dsx3FracIfIndex.2.27 = 6 dsx3FracIfIndex.2.14 = 5 dsx3FracIfIndex.2.28 = 6 For dsx3M23, dsx3 SYNTRAN, dsx3CbitParity, and dsx3ClearChannel there are 28 legal channels, numbered 1 through 28. For e3Framed there are 16 legal channels, numbered 1 through 16. The channels (1..16) correspond directly to the equivalently numbered time-slots."
