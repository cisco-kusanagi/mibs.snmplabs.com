    "description": "A desired G.Bond port data rate in the upstream direction, in Kbps, to be achieved during initialization, under restrictions placed upon the member BCEs by their respective configuration settings. This object represents a sum of individual BCE upstream data rates, modified to compensate for fragmentation and encapsulation overhead (e.g., for an Ethernet service, the target data rate of 10 Mbps SHALL allow lossless transmission of full-duplex 10-Mbps Ethernet frame stream with minimal inter-frame gap). Note that the target upstream data rate may not be achieved during initialization (e.g., due to unavailability of required BCEs) or the initial bandwidth could deteriorate, so that the actual upstream data rate (gBondPortStatUpDataRate) could be less than gBondPortConfTargetUpDataRate. The value is limited above by 10 Gbps, to accommodate very high speed bonded xDSL interfaces (e.g., 32 x 100 Mbps). The value between 1 and 10000000 indicates that the total upstream data rate of the G.Bond port after initialization SHALL be equal to the target data rate or less, if the target upstream data rate cannot be achieved under the restrictions configured for BCEs. In cases where the copper environment allows a higher upstream data rate to be achieved than that specified by this object, the excess capability SHALL be either converted to an additional SNR margin or reclaimed by minimizing transmit power. The value of 0 means that the target data rate is not fixed and SHALL be set to the maximum attainable rate during initialization (best effort), under specified spectral restrictions and with a desired SNR margin per BCE. This object is read-write for the -O subtype G.Bond ports. It is irrelevant for the -R subtypes -- attempts to read or change this object for such ports MUST be rejected (in the case of SNMP, with the error inconsistentValue).

This object represents a sum of individual BCE downstream data rates, modified to compensate for fragmentation and encapsulation overhead (e.g., for an Ethernet service, the target data rate of 10 Mbps SHALL allow lossless transmission of full-duplex 10-Mbps Ethernet frame stream with minimal inter-frame gap). Note that the target downstream data rate may not be achieved during initialization (e.g., due to unavailability of required BCEs) or the initial bandwidth could deteriorate, so that the actual downstream data rate (gBondPortStatDnDataRate) could be less than gBondPortConfTargetDnDataRate. The value is limited above by 10 Gbps, to accommodate very high speed bonded xDSL interfaces (e.g., 32 x 100 Mbps). The value between 1 and 10000000 indicates that the total downstream data rate of the G.Bond port after initialization SHALL be equal to the target data rate or less, if the target downstream data rate cannot be achieved under the restrictions configured for BCEs. In cases where the copper environment allows a higher downstream data rate to be achieved than that specified by this object, the excess capability SHALL be either converted to an additional SNR margin or reclaimed by minimizing transmit power. The value of 0 means that the target data rate is not fixed and SHALL be set to the maximum attainable rate during initialization (best effort), under specified spectral restrictions and with a desired SNR margin per BCE.
