The value hotStandby indicates that the resource is not providing service but will be immediately able to take over the role of the resource to be backed up, without initialization activity, and containing the same information as the resource to be backed up. The value coldStandby indicates the resource is a backup for another resource but will not be immediately able to take over the role of the backed up resource and will require some initialization activity.

Note that the multiport cell-based cards have one common clock source for all ports. For this reason, the following rules apply for the value of clockingSource across the board's three ports: All three clockingSource values must be 'local' OR All three clockingSource values must be 'module' OR One clockingSource value must be 'line' and the other two must be 'otherPort'. If there is no NS component provisioned, the default value for this attribute will be local. If the NS component has been provisioned, the default value is module, except for the 1pDS3C cards. For the 1pDS3C cards, the default and only valid value for this attribute is local. The clockingSource of the DS1 sub-component becomes the effective clocking source for this attribute.

The local end transmits the loopCode pattern to cause the remote end to apply a loopback, after which the local end should receive the loopCode pattern. The exact pattern used to request loopCode depends on the test type. This failure indicates a high rate of transmission errors, or that the remote end has failed to apply the loopback. patternSyncFailed indicates that the local end failed to synchronize to the frmPatternType test pattern, that should have been looped back at the remote end. This failure indicates a high rate of transmission errors or the absence of a loopback. patternSyncLost indicates that the local end gained and then lost synchronization to the returned frmPatternType test pattern. This failure indicates a sudden increase in transmission errors, frame slippage, or the removal of an existing loopback. unknown is set when a reason to terminate other than those listed here is encountered.

The result is presented in the form of xEsyy, where x is the mantissa, syy is the exponent, for example 0E+00, 2E-09. Note that the bitErrorRate is an estimate only.

In ATM cell direct mapping mode, an LCD defect occurs when Out of Cell Delineation (OCD) anomaly persists for x milliseconds, and disappears when the Out of Cell Delineation (OCD) is absent for x msec. An OCD anomaly occurs when 7 consecutive incorrect HECs have been detected. An OCD anomaly terminates when 6 consecutive correct HECs have been detected. For an AtmCell component located under a DS3 or E3 component with mapping = PLCP, the LCD defect is directly derived from the PLCP LOF defect. If LCD defects are intermittently occurring, the LCD defect accumulator is decremented at a rate of 1/10 of the incrementing rate (alarm integration ratio of 1/10), with all measurements based on a 200 ms polling cycle The component under which is located the AtmCell component goes into an operational state of disabled until the LCD alarm condition is cleared. The condition is cleared after the LCD defect has not been reported for a period of 10 seconds +/- 0.5 seconds. The lcdAlarm attribute is always set to off when the parent of the AtmCell component has been locked and left offline. This can also happen when the Path or Channel component has been suspended since its parent has been locked."

Also, the operator will be allowed to issue commands for only those components which have a matching CID. An operator CID of 0 is used to identify the Network Manager (referred to as 'NetMan' in DPN). This CID matches the CID of any component.

The local end transmits the loopCode pattern to cause the remote end to apply a loopback, after which the local end should receive the loopCode pattern. The exact pattern used to request loopCode depends on the test type. This failure indicates a high rate of transmission errors, or that the remote end has failed to apply the loopback. patternSyncFailed indicates that the local end failed to synchronize to the frmPatternType test pattern, that should have been looped back at the remote end. This failure indicates a high rate of transmission errors or the absence of a loopback. patternSyncLost indicates that the local end gained and then lost synchronization to the returned frmPatternType test pattern. This failure indicates a sudden increase in transmission errors, frame slippage, or the removal of an existing loopback. unknown is set when a reason to terminate other than those listed here is encountered.

In ATM cell direct mapping mode, an LCD defect occurs when Out of Cell Delineation (OCD) anomaly persists for x milliseconds, and disappears when the Out of Cell Delineation (OCD) is absent for x msec. An OCD anomaly occurs when 7 consecutive incorrect HECs have been detected. An OCD anomaly terminates when 6 consecutive correct HECs have been detected. For an AtmCell component located under a DS3 or E3 component with mapping = PLCP, the LCD defect is directly derived from the PLCP LOF defect. If LCD defects are intermittently occurring, the LCD defect accumulator is decremented at a rate of 1/10 of the incrementing rate (alarm integration ratio of 1/10), with all measurements based on a 200 ms polling cycle The component under which is located the AtmCell component goes into an operational state of disabled until the LCD alarm condition is cleared. The condition is cleared after the LCD defect has not been reported for a period of 10 seconds +/- 0.5 seconds. The lcdAlarm attribute is always set to off when the parent of the AtmCell component has been locked and left offline. This can also happen when the Path or Channel component has been suspended since its parent has been locked."

This failure indicates a high rate of transmission errors or the absence of a loopback. patternSyncLost indicates that the local end gained and then lost synchronization to the returned frmPatternType test pattern. This failure indicates a sudden increase in transmission errors, frame slippage, or the removal of an existing loopback. unknown is set when a reason to terminate other than those listed here is encountered.

The Test component will try to estimate the number of bit errors in any errored frame which is identifiable. The statistics will be updated accordingly. A lost frame (may be due to an error on the flag sequence) will be discarded for the bit error rate calculation. The result is presented in the form of xEsyy, where x is the mantissa, syy is the exponent, for example 0E+00, 2E-09. Note that the bitErrorRate is an estimate only. For more reliable test results, the test should be done over a long period. Multiple tests would also improve the confidence level of the test results."

An AIS alarm state is entered when AIS defects have been observed and accumulated for a period of 2.5 seconds +/- 0.5 seconds on the incoming E3 line. An AIS defect is the occurrence of the AIS (unframed signal with a density of zeros below a certain threshold such as defined by ITU Recommendation G.775). If the AIS defects are intermittently occurring, the AIS defect accumulator is decremented at a rate of 1/ 10 of the incrementing rate (alarm integration ratio of 1/10), with all measurements based on a 200 ms polling cycle. The E3 component goes into an operational state of disabled until the AIS alarm condition is cleared (after AIS has been no longer detected for a period of 10 seconds +/- 0.5 seconds). As long as AIS is detected on the incoming line, the node also transmits the far-end SEF/AIS (in G.751 E3) or FERF (in G.832) defect indicator over the outgoing line. The txRai attribute is set to on when transmitting the far-end SEF/AIS defect indicator on the outgoing line. The rxAisAlarm attribute is always set to off when the component has been locked and left offline."

This failure indicates a high rate of transmission errors or the absence of a loopback. patternSyncLost indicates that the local end gained and then lost synchronization to the returned frmPatternType test pattern. This failure indicates a sudden increase in transmission errors, frame slippage, or the removal of an existing loopback. unknown is set when a reason to terminate other than those listed here is encountered.

For all other card types, this attribute is the calculated bit error rate on the link. Test data are generated and sent in frames of a preset size (frameSize). The Test component will try to estimate the number of bit errors in any errored frame which is identifiable. The statistics will be updated accordingly. A lost frame (may be due to an error on the flag sequence) will be discarded for the bit error rate calculation. The result is presented in the form of xEsyy, where x is the mantissa, syy is the exponent, for example 0E+00, 2E-09. Note that the bitErrorRate is an estimate only. For more reliable test results, the test should be done over a long period. Multiple tests would also improve the confidence level of the test results."

An LOF defect occurs when an OOF (Out of Frame) state persists for more than 1 ms. If the OOF events are intermittent, the LOF defect counter is decremented at a rate of 1/12 (for DS3 PLCP) or 1/9 (for G.751 E3 PLCP) of the incrementing rate, with all measurements based on a 200 ms polling cycle. An OOF event (also known as a PLCP SEF event) is declared when an error is detected in both the A1 and A2 octets, or when two consecutive POHIDs are found in error. OOF is removed when two valid sets of framing octets and two valid and sequential POHID octets have been found. The LOF defect is removed when the defect counter reaches zero, i.e. when OOF events are absent for more than 12 ms (DS3 PLCP) or 9 ms (G.751 E3 PLCP). LOF failure alarm is cleared when LOF defect is absent for 10.0 s +/- 0.5 s The DS3 or E3 component goes into an operational state of disabled until the LOF failure alarm is cleared. The terminal declaring the LOF failure alarm will transmit a PLCP RAI signal to the far-end for the duration of the alarm. The lofAlarm attribute is always set to off when the DS3 or E3 component has been locked and left offline."

In ATM cell direct mapping mode, an LCD defect occurs when Out of Cell Delineation (OCD) anomaly persists for x milliseconds, and disappears when the Out of Cell Delineation (OCD) is absent for x msec. An OCD anomaly occurs when 7 consecutive incorrect HECs have been detected. An OCD anomaly terminates when 6 consecutive correct HECs have been detected. For an AtmCell component located under a DS3 or E3 component with mapping = PLCP, the LCD defect is directly derived from the PLCP LOF defect. If LCD defects are intermittently occurring, the LCD defect accumulator is decremented at a rate of 1/10 of the incrementing rate (alarm integration ratio of 1/10), with all measurements based on a 200 ms polling cycle The component under which is located the AtmCell component goes into an operational state of disabled until the LCD alarm condition is cleared. The condition is cleared after the LCD defect has not been reported for a period of 10 seconds +/- 0.5 seconds. The lcdAlarm attribute is always set to off when the parent of the AtmCell component has been locked and left offline. This can also happen when the Path or Channel component has been suspended since its parent has been locked."

On 4DS1Aal1 cards either: all four ports' clockingSource values must be local OR all four ports' clockingSource values must be module OR one port's clockingSource value must be line and the other three must be otherPort. A port can only have srtsMode selected if the other ports are module or srtsMode."

Note that for lineType of d4, only the SBit and the Bit2 methods are applicable. Whereas for lineType of esf, only the Bit2 and the fdl methods are applicable. SBit method is recommended if lineType is set to d4 and zeroCoding is set to ami. This will help to avoid potential mimic RAI alarm when 1's density is too low in the data transmitted.

If the zeroCoding is B8ZS (where supported on the FP) or none, the timeslot's data rate will be 64kbit/ s. If the zeroCoding option is bit7Stuffing, the data rate of a timeslot will be 56kbit/s. When 56k is selected for a channel on a DS1, the least significant bit of each timeslot of this Channel will always be set to 1 and not used for data. The data rate for the timeslots of this channel is therefore restricted to 56kbit/s.

This failure indicates a high rate of transmission errors or the absence of a loopback. patternSyncLost indicates that the local end gained and then lost synchronization to the returned frmPatternType test pattern. This failure indicates a sudden increase in transmission errors, frame slippage, or the removal of an existing loopback. unknown is set when a reason to terminate other than those listed here is encountered.

A lost frame (may be due to an error on the flag sequence) will be discarded for the bit error rate calculation. The result is presented in the form of xEsyy, where x is the mantissa, syy is the exponent, for example 0E+00, 2E-09. Note that the bitErrorRate is an estimate only. For more reliable test results, the test should be done over a long period. Multiple tests would also improve the confidence level of the test results."

An OCD anomaly occurs when 7 consecutive incorrect HECs have been detected. An OCD anomaly terminates when 6 consecutive correct HECs have been detected. For an AtmCell component located under a DS3 or E3 component with mapping = PLCP, the LCD defect is directly derived from the PLCP LOF defect. If LCD defects are intermittently occurring, the LCD defect accumulator is decremented at a rate of 1/10 of the incrementing rate (alarm integration ratio of 1/10), with all measurements based on a 200 ms polling cycle The component under which is located the AtmCell component goes into an operational state of disabled until the LCD alarm condition is cleared.

Note: Only MSA cards support recognition of the failures loopCodeSyncFailed, patternSyncFailed and patternSyncLost. Other cards will not terminate the test under the conditions described by these values."

A lost frame (may be due to an error on the flag sequence) will be discarded for the bit error rate calculation. The result is presented in the form of xEsyy, where x is the mantissa, syy is the exponent, for example 0E+00, 2E-09. Note that the bitErrorRate is an estimate only.

If the zeroCoding is B8ZS (where supported on the FP) or none, the timeslot's data rate will be 64kbit/ s. If the zeroCoding option is bit7Stuffing, the data rate of a timeslot will be 56kbit/s. When 56k is selected for a channel on a DS1, the least significant bit of each timeslot of this Channel will always be set to 1 and not used for data. The data rate for the timeslots of this channel is therefore restricted to 56kbit/s.

The local end transmits the loopCode pattern to cause the remote end to apply a loopback, after which the local end should receive the loopCode pattern. The exact pattern used to request loopCode depends on the test type. This failure indicates a high rate of transmission errors, or that the remote end has failed to apply the loopback. patternSyncFailed indicates that the local end failed to synchronize to the frmPatternType test pattern, that should have been looped back at the remote end. This failure indicates a high rate of transmission errors or the absence of a loopback. patternSyncLost indicates that the local end gained and then lost synchronization to the returned frmPatternType test pattern. This failure indicates a sudden increase in transmission errors, frame slippage, or the removal of an existing loopback. unknown is set when a reason to terminate other than those listed here is encountered. Note: Only MSA cards support recognition of the failures loopCodeSyncFailed, patternSyncFailed and patternSyncLost. Other cards will not terminate the test under the conditions described by these values."

A lost frame (may be due to an error on the flag sequence) will be discarded for the bit error rate calculation. The result is presented in the form of xEsyy, where x is the mantissa, syy is the exponent, for example 0E+00, 2E-09. Note that the bitErrorRate is an estimate only.

In ATM cell direct mapping mode, an LCD defect occurs when Out of Cell Delineation (OCD) anomaly persists for x milliseconds, and disappears when the Out of Cell Delineation (OCD) is absent for x msec. An OCD anomaly occurs when 7 consecutive incorrect HECs have been detected. An OCD anomaly terminates when 6 consecutive correct HECs have been detected. For an AtmCell component located under a DS3 or E3 component with mapping = PLCP, the LCD defect is directly derived from the PLCP LOF defect. If LCD defects are intermittently occurring, the LCD defect accumulator is decremented at a rate of 1/10 of the incrementing rate (alarm integration ratio of 1/10), with all measurements based on a 200 ms polling cycle The component under which is located the AtmCell component goes into an operational state of disabled until the LCD alarm condition is cleared. The condition is cleared after the LCD defect has not been reported for a period of 10 seconds +/- 0.5 seconds. The lcdAlarm attribute is always set to off when the parent of the AtmCell component has been locked and left offline. This can also happen when the Path or Channel component has been suspended since its parent has been locked."

This failure indicates a high rate of transmission errors or the absence of a loopback. patternSyncLost indicates that the local end gained and then lost synchronization to the returned frmPatternType test pattern. This failure indicates a sudden increase in transmission errors, frame slippage, or the removal of an existing loopback. unknown is set when a reason to terminate other than those listed here is encountered.

For all other card types, this attribute is the calculated bit error rate on the link. Test data are generated and sent in frames of a preset size (frameSize). The Test component will try to estimate the number of bit errors in any errored frame which is identifiable. The statistics will be updated accordingly. A lost frame (may be due to an error on the flag sequence) will be discarded for the bit error rate calculation. The result is presented in the form of xEsyy, where x is the mantissa, syy is the exponent, for example 0E+00, 2E-09. Note that the bitErrorRate is an estimate only. For more reliable test results, the test should be done over a long period. Multiple tests would also improve the confidence level of the test results."

The local end transmits the loopCode pattern to cause the remote end to apply a loopback, after which the local end should receive the loopCode pattern. The exact pattern used to request loopCode depends on the test type. This failure indicates a high rate of transmission errors, or that the remote end has failed to apply the loopback. patternSyncFailed indicates that the local end failed to synchronize to the frmPatternType test pattern, that should have been looped back at the remote end. This failure indicates a high rate of transmission errors or the absence of a loopback. patternSyncLost indicates that the local end gained and then lost synchronization to the returned frmPatternType test pattern. This failure indicates a sudden increase in transmission errors, frame slippage, or the removal of an existing loopback. unknown is set when a reason to terminate other than those listed here is encountered.

The local end transmits the loopCode pattern to cause the remote end to apply a loopback, after which the local end should receive the loopCode pattern. The exact pattern used to request loopCode depends on the test type. This failure indicates a high rate of transmission errors, or that the remote end has failed to apply the loopback. patternSyncFailed indicates that the local end failed to synchronize to the frmPatternType test pattern, that should have been looped back at the remote end. This failure indicates a high rate of transmission errors or the absence of a loopback. patternSyncLost indicates that the local end gained and then lost synchronization to the returned frmPatternType test pattern. This failure indicates a sudden increase in transmission errors, frame slippage, or the removal of an existing loopback. unknown is set when a reason to terminate other than those listed here is encountered. Note: Only MSA cards support recognition of the failures loopCodeSyncFailed, patternSyncFailed and patternSyncLost. Other cards will not terminate the test under the conditions described by these values."

A lost frame (may be due to an error on the flag sequence) will be discarded for the bit error rate calculation. The result is presented in the form of xEsyy, where x is the mantissa, syy is the exponent, for example 0E+00, 2E-09. Note that the bitErrorRate is an estimate only. For more reliable test results, the test should be done over a long period. Multiple tests would also improve the confidence level of the test results."

An OCD anomaly occurs when 7 consecutive incorrect HECs have been detected. An OCD anomaly terminates when 6 consecutive correct HECs have been detected. For an AtmCell component located under a DS3 or E3 component with mapping = PLCP, the LCD defect is directly derived from the PLCP LOF defect. If LCD defects are intermittently occurring, the LCD defect accumulator is decremented at a rate of 1/10 of the incrementing rate (alarm integration ratio of 1/10), with all measurements based on a 200 ms polling cycle The component under which is located the AtmCell component goes into an operational state of disabled until the LCD alarm condition is cleared.

The local end transmits the loopCode pattern to cause the remote end to apply a loopback, after which the local end should receive the loopCode pattern. The exact pattern used to request loopCode depends on the test type. This failure indicates a high rate of transmission errors, or that the remote end has failed to apply the loopback. patternSyncFailed indicates that the local end failed to synchronize to the frmPatternType test pattern, that should have been looped back at the remote end. This failure indicates a high rate of transmission errors or the absence of a loopback. patternSyncLost indicates that the local end gained and then lost synchronization to the returned frmPatternType test pattern. This failure indicates a sudden increase in transmission errors, frame slippage, or the removal of an existing loopback. unknown is set when a reason to terminate other than those listed here is encountered. Note: Only MSA cards support recognition of the failures loopCodeSyncFailed, patternSyncFailed and patternSyncLost. Other cards will not terminate the test under the conditions described by these values."

A lost frame (may be due to an error on the flag sequence) will be discarded for the bit error rate calculation. The result is presented in the form of xEsyy, where x is the mantissa, syy is the exponent, for example 0E+00, 2E-09. Note that the bitErrorRate is an estimate only. For more reliable test results, the test should be done over a long period. Multiple tests would also improve the confidence level of the test results."

If the L-AIS defects are intermittently occurring, the L-AIS defect accumulator is decremented at a rate of 1/10 of the incrementing rate (alarm integration ratio of 1/10), with all measurements based on a 200 ms polling cycle. The Sonet/Sdh component goes into an operational state of disabled until the L-AIS alarm condition is cleared. The condition is cleared after not detecting the L-AIS signal for a period of 10 seconds +/- 0.5 seconds. The rxAisAlarm attribute is always set to off when the component has been locked and left offline."

An OCD anomaly occurs when 7 consecutive incorrect HECs have been detected. An OCD anomaly terminates when 6 consecutive correct HECs have been detected. For an AtmCell component located under a DS3 or E3 component with mapping = PLCP, the LCD defect is directly derived from the PLCP LOF defect. If LCD defects are intermittently occurring, the LCD defect accumulator is decremented at a rate of 1/10 of the incrementing rate (alarm integration ratio of 1/10), with all measurements based on a 200 ms polling cycle The component under which is located the AtmCell component goes into an operational state of disabled until the LCD alarm condition is cleared.

The local end transmits the loopCode pattern to cause the remote end to apply a loopback, after which the local end should receive the loopCode pattern. The exact pattern used to request loopCode depends on the test type. This failure indicates a high rate of transmission errors, or that the remote end has failed to apply the loopback. patternSyncFailed indicates that the local end failed to synchronize to the frmPatternType test pattern, that should have been looped back at the remote end. This failure indicates a high rate of transmission errors or the absence of a loopback. patternSyncLost indicates that the local end gained and then lost synchronization to the returned frmPatternType test pattern. This failure indicates a sudden increase in transmission errors, frame slippage, or the removal of an existing loopback. unknown is set when a reason to terminate other than those listed here is encountered. Note: Only MSA cards support recognition of the failures loopCodeSyncFailed, patternSyncFailed and patternSyncLost. Other cards will not terminate the test under the conditions described by these values."

A lost frame (may be due to an error on the flag sequence) will be discarded for the bit error rate calculation. The result is presented in the form of xEsyy, where x is the mantissa, syy is the exponent, for example 0E+00, 2E-09. Note that the bitErrorRate is an estimate only.

A Payload AIS alarm state is entered when a Payload AIS defect persists for a period of 2.5 seconds +/- 0.5 seconds. A Payload AIS defect is declared when the incoming signal of the 6312 kbit/s frame payload (TS1 - TS96) has two or less zeros in a sequence of 3,072 bits (0.5 ms). If the payload AIS defects are intermittently occurring, the payload AIS defect accumulator is decremented at a rate of 1/10 of the incrementing rate (alarm integration ratio of 1/10), with all measurements based on a 200 ms polling cycle. A Payload AIS failure alarm is cleared when the Payload AIS defect is absent for a period of 10 seconds +/- 0.5 seconds. The port goes into an operationalState of disabled until the AIS alarm condition is cleared. While the port is in the Payload AIS alarm state, the node also transmits the far-end RAI defect indicator on the out-going JT2 line."

This failure indicates a high rate of transmission errors or the absence of a loopback. patternSyncLost indicates that the local end gained and then lost synchronization to the returned frmPatternType test pattern. This failure indicates a sudden increase in transmission errors, frame slippage, or the removal of an existing loopback. unknown is set when a reason to terminate other than those listed here is encountered.

For all other card types, this attribute is the calculated bit error rate on the link. Test data are generated and sent in frames of a preset size (frameSize). The Test component will try to estimate the number of bit errors in any errored frame which is identifiable. The statistics will be updated accordingly. A lost frame (may be due to an error on the flag sequence) will be discarded for the bit error rate calculation. The result is presented in the form of xEsyy, where x is the mantissa, syy is the exponent, for example 0E+00, 2E-09. Note that the bitErrorRate is an estimate only. For more reliable test results, the test should be done over a long period. Multiple tests would also improve the confidence level of the test results."

An OCD anomaly occurs when 7 consecutive incorrect HECs have been detected. An OCD anomaly terminates when 6 consecutive correct HECs have been detected. For an AtmCell component located under a DS3 or E3 component with mapping = PLCP, the LCD defect is directly derived from the PLCP LOF defect. If LCD defects are intermittently occurring, the LCD defect accumulator is decremented at a rate of 1/10 of the incrementing rate (alarm integration ratio of 1/10), with all measurements based on a 200 ms polling cycle The component under which is located the AtmCell component goes into an operational state of disabled until the LCD alarm condition is cleared. The condition is cleared after the LCD defect has not been reported for a period of 10 seconds +/- 0.5 seconds. The lcdAlarm attribute is always set to off when the parent of the AtmCell component has been locked and left offline.

This failure indicates a high rate of transmission errors or the absence of a loopback. patternSyncLost indicates that the local end gained and then lost synchronization to the returned frmPatternType test pattern. This failure indicates a sudden increase in transmission errors, frame slippage, or the removal of an existing loopback. unknown is set when a reason to terminate other than those listed here is encountered.

    "description": "This attribute is not displayed for ATM cards because the physical layer drops all errored frames at the controller interface. For all other card types, this attribute is the calculated bit error rate on the link. Test data are generated and sent in frames of a preset size (frameSize). The Test component will try to estimate the number of bit errors in any errored frame which is identifiable. The statistics will be updated accordingly. A lost frame (may be due to an error on the flag sequence) will be discarded for the bit error rate calculation. The result is presented in the form of xEsyy, where x is the mantissa, syy is the exponent, for example 0E+00, 2E-09. Note that the bitErrorRate is an estimate only. For more reliable test results, the test should be done over a long period. Multiple tests would also improve the confidence level of the test results."
