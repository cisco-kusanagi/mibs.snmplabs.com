This is used as the default for all the connections on the interface. When translationMode is selected, the interworking function performs translations between RFC1490 and RFC1483 encapsulated headers. This includes routed protocol translation, bridged protocol translation, and connection oriented protocol translation (except for RFC 1490 connection oriented protocol without RFC 1490 header, which is done in speTranslationMode). A value of transparentMode indicates that the interworking function is forwarding data without altering the upper layer user protocol encapsulation. Use transparent mode when the upper layer user protocol encapsulation methods are compatible between terminal equipments. A value of speTranslationMode indicates that the interworking function performs single protocol translation between RFC1490 with no header and RFC1483 encapsulated packets."

    "description": "This attribute specifies the traffic parameter conversion policy to use for a specific transfer priority for specifying equivalent bandwidth rate at the FrAtm interface. Policy 3 characterizes the traffic in the following way: - ATM traffic descriptor type 6 is selected - ATM service category rtVbr and nrtVbr supported only - PCR0+1 is based on AR - SCR0+1 is based on CIR and EIR - MBS0+1 is based on Bc, Be, CIR, EIR and AR - Takes into account that the instantaneous rate of the Frame Relay stream can be above CIR and up to the AR. Policy 4 characterizes the traffic in the following way: - ATM traffic descriptor type 7 or 8 is selected. Type 7 is chosen when non-conforming cells are to be discarded and type 8 when non-conforming cells are tagged by the UPC traffic policer. - PCR0+1 is based on AR - ATM service category rtVbr and nrtVbr supported only - SCR0 is based on CIR - MBS0 is based on Bc, CIR, and AR - There is no direct characterization of EIR. The allowed EIR can be derived using the difference between the AR and CIR. Policy 5 characterizes the traffic in the following way: - ATM traffic descriptor type 7 or 8 is selected. Type 7 is chosen when non-conforming cells are to be discarded and type 8 when non-conforming cells are tagged by the UPC traffic policer. - ATM service category rtVbr and nrtVbr supported only - PCR0+1 is based on CIR for descriptor type 7 - PCR0+1 is based on CIR and EIR for descriptor type 8 - SCR0 is based on CIR - MBS0 is based on Bc, CIR, and AR - The maximum PCR is no longer based on the AR but rather on the CIR and EIR or CIR Policy 6 characterizes the traffic in the following way: - ATM traffic descriptor type 3 is selected - ATM service category ubr, cbr, rtVbr and nrtVbr supported only - PCR0+1 is based only on CIR. The default value sameAsModule implies the trafficParmConversionPolicy of Mod Frs AtmNet Tpm/n is as defined as Mod Frs AtmNet Tpm/n."
