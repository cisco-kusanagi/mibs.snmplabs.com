    DESCRIPTION
        "The value of this object determines the mode used by the CM for IP 
         provisioning.  
        
         If set to the default value of mdd(0), the CM will comply with the 
         DOCSIS 3.0 specification and use the mode identified in the IP 
         provisioning mode field of the MDD message received from the CMTS.
        
         If set to any other value, the CM will ignore the IP provisioning mode
         field of the MDD message and use the mode specified by this object
         instead.
         
         If the DOCSIS config file contains a TLV which changes the value of 
         this object from its current value, the CM will abandon its current IP 
         settings and restart the IP provisioning and registration process using 
         the new mode.  Setting this object using SNMP does not cause a 
         restart; in the case of an SNMP set, the new mode will take effect 
         the next time the CM registers with a CMTS.
         
         Note that this object may also be used to invoke IPv6 or dual-stack 
         operation when using a pre-DOCSIS 3.0 CMTS, provided the network 
         hosting the CM is IPv6 capable.
         
         Further note that a CM which does not support IPv6 will always report
         ipV4Only(1) for this object, and an attempt to set the object to any
         other value will be rejected with an inconsistentValue error.
         
         If this object is set to a value which is incompatible with the 
         capabilities of the associated CMTS or network, then IP provisioning 
         may fail.  This setting is persistent across reboots."

         in the DOCS-CABLE-DEVICE-MIB.  The key difference is that the filters 
         described by the cmHostIpFilterTable are not applied to bridged  
         traffic, but rather to traffic which is sent from or received by the 
         cablemodem itself, acting in a role as a host.
         
         This table may be used to restrict certain IP traffic (eg SNMP, 
         TFTP, telnet, etc.) from being accessible via the CPE and / or HFC
         interfaces.  Note that all filters will be applied to all IP
         addresses associated with this host.
         
         Caution must be exercised in the use of this table.  For example, it 
         is possible to render the device unmanageable if SNMP is prohibited 
         over both CPE and CM interfaces."
