    DESCRIPTION
        "Alarm MIB for Tail-f Systems. This MIB represents alarms as 
         states, where a row in the alarm table corresponds to a 
         device, an object within the device and an unique alarm type. 
         If the severity of an alarm or a the clear state is changed
         this is an update to an existing alarm entry and not a new.
         When the resource reports a clear on the alarm the alarm
         entry still exists until administrative processes purges
         the alarm list. These procedures are out of the scope for 
         this module."
