                Summary of corrections and additions:
                1.  DisplayString textual conventions modified to only 
                    allow printable characters.
                2.  deviceMibVersion description updated to reflect the 
                    new version number.
                3.  New ethernetIfIpAddressConflict object replacing 
                    the ethernetIfMtu object.
                4.  New deviceNatoStockNumber, deviceMode and deviceReset 
                    objects added.
                5.  Ranges added to the bit depth, FPS and SAP message 
                    interval objects in the video format and channel 
                    control tables.
                6.  New videoFormatColorimetry object added to the 
                    preset video format table. 
                7.  New compression, ROI and RPT payload type objects 
                    added to the video format table to support default 
                    configuration start-up. 
                8.  channelReset object allows one or more channels to be 
                    reset independently from the rest of the device.
                9.  channelStatus object includes single frame mode.
                10. New channelColorimetry object added.
                11. channelCompressionFactor changed to read-only access
                    and loaded from videoFormatTable when setting channel.
                12. New ROI bottom and right extent objects added with 
                    changes to resolution and ROI objects to support 
                    decimation and interpolation of ROIs, and scaling and 
                    cropping of display images.
                13. New channelDefaultVideoFormatIndex and 
                    channelDefaultReceiveIpAddress objects added to 
                    support default configuration start-up.
                14. Notification objects added for device errors and 
                    IP address conflicts.
                15. Conformance group replace with groups to identify
                    preset objects, channel configuration objects, 
                    maintenance mode objects and volatile objects."
