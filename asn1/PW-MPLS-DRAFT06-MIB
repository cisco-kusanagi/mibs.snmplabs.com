          indexing of a TE tunnel head-end are used as in  
          MPLS-TE-STD-MIB are to be configured, and the tunnel  
          instance indicates the LSP that is currently in use for  
          forwarding the traffic. 
   
          In case of signaled Non-TE MPLS (an outer tunnel label  
          assigned by LDP) the table points to the XC entry in the  
          LSR-STD-MIB. If the Non-TE MPLS tunnel is manually  
          configured, the operator configure the XC pointer to this 
          tunnel. 
   
          In case of PW label only (no outer tunnel) the ifIndex of  
          the port to carry the PW is configured here.  
           
          It is possible to associate a PW to one TE tunnel head-end  
          and a non-TE tunnel together. An indication in this table

 8 Security Considerations 
   
  It is clear that this MIB module is potentially useful for 
  monitoring of PW capable PEs.  This MIB module can also be used for 
  configuration of certain objects, and anything that can be 
  configured can be incorrectly configured, with potentially 
  disastrous results. 
      
  There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module 
  with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such 
  objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network 
  environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure 
  environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on 
  network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their 
  sensitivity/vulnerability: 
   
     o    the pwVcMplsTable, pwVcMplsNonTeMappingTable and 
          pwVcMplsTeMappingTable collectively contain objects to  
          provision PW over MPLS tunnels.  Unauthorized access to  
          objects in these tables, could result in disruption of  
          traffic on the network.  The use of stronger mechanisms  
          such as SNMPv3 security should be considered where  
          possible.  Specifically, SNMPv3 VACM and USM MUST be used  
          with any v3 agent which implements this MIB module.   
                     Pseudo Wire (PW) Over MPLS             June 2004 
                    Management Information Base 


          Administrators should consider whether read access to these  
          objects should be allowed, since read access may be  
          undesirable under certain circumstances. 
   
  Some of the readable objects in this MIB module "i.e., objects with 
  a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible" may be considered sensitive 
  or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important 
  to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and 
  possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending 
  them over the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects 
  and their sensitivity/vulnerability: 
   
     o    the pwVcMplsTable, pwVcMplsNonTeMappingTable,  
          pwVcMplsTeMappingTable and pwVcMplsOutboundTable  
          collectively show the PW over MPLS association.   
          If an Administrator does not want to reveal this 
          information, then these tables should be 
          considered sensitive/vulnerable. 
   
  SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. 
  Even if the network itself is secure "for example by using IPSec", 
  even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is 
  allowed to access and GET/SET "read/change/create/delete" the 
  objects in this MIB module. 
   
  It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features 
  as provided by the SNMPv3 framework "see [RFC3410], section 8", 
  including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms "for 
  authentication and privacy". 
   
  Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
  RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
  enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
  responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an 
  instance of this MIB module, is properly configured to give access 
  to the objects only to those principals "users" that have 
  legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET "change/create/delete" them. 
   
 9 IANA considerations 
   
  As requested in the PW-TC-STD-MIB [PWTCMIB], PWE3 related standards 
  track MIB modules should be rooted under the pwStdMIB subtree. The 
  IANA is requested to assign { pwStdMIB 3 } to the PW-MPLS-STD-MIB 
  module specified in this document.
