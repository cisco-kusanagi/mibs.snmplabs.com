-- Overview :
--
-- The Madge box MIB defines manageable objects that are common to all
-- Madge products.
--
-- The Madge box MIB contains the following groups :-
--
--  madgeConfig   - This group contains general configuration information
--                  for the device. Such as IP address / serial number /
--                  admin status etc.
--
--  madgeSecure   - This group contains 3 tables. a list of allowed users,
--                  a list of trap destinations and a list of current users.
--
--  madgeDownload - This group contains all of the variables required to
--                  configure / monitor a download to a device using TFTP
--                  or RPL.
--
--  madgeIP       - This group provides information about the current IP
--                  configuration of a device. It contains the current IP
--                  address / gateway and an indication of whether the IP
--                  address was obtained from the Config group or via BOOTP
--                  or RARP.
--
--  madgeVersion  - This group provides version information for all hardware
--                  or software components within a device. This MIB
--                  identifies the Flash banks that can be downloaded into.
--
--  madgeTrap     = This group provides a mechanism for enabling / disabling
--                  the generation of specific traps by a device.
--
--  madgeUpload   - This group contains the variables required to configure
--                  and monitor an upload from a device using TFTP
